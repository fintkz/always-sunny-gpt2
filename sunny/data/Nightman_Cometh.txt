                          Anybody else been having trouble
                          getting laid lately. I can’t figure
                          out what my problem is.

                                    DEE (O.S.)
                          Um, I can think of a million
                          reasons why you’re not getting
                          laid, Frank. But, the most obvious
                          one is that you smell like eggs.

        FADE IN:

1       INT. PADDY’S PUB - NIGHT (NIGHT 1)                                                                      1

        Frank sit’s at the bar drinking. Dee works the bar. Mac and
        Dennis shoot pool.

                                    FRANK
                          That’s crazy. I don’t smell like
                          eggs.

                                    DEE
                          I’m willing to bet you’ve got at
                          least one egg on you right now.

                                    FRANK
                          What? Come on! Why would I have
                          eggs on me?

                                    DEE
                          What’s that in your front pocket?

                                    FRANK
                          Nothing. Sack of coins.

                                    DEE
                          Let me see.

                                    FRANK
                          Alright, I gotta a couple hard
                          boiled eggs on me, okay. Big deal.
                          I like eggs. Get off my case.

    Charlie comes barrelling out of the back office holding reams
    of paper.

                                CHARLIE
                      Alright it’s done. I’ve done it and
                      it’s brilliant!

                                DENNIS
                      What could you have possibly done
                      that is brilliant?

                                CHARLIE
                      I’ve written a musical.

                                MAC
                      Why did you write a musical?

                                CHARLIE
                      Because I’ve always wanted to.
                      That’s why. Does there have to be a
                      reason?

                                MAC
                      Yes. Nobody just writes a musical
                      for no reason. It’s doesn’t make
                      sense.

                                FRANK
                      Alright, I see what you’re doing.
                      Who’s the mark?

                                 CHARLIE
                      Huh? No, there’s no mark, Frank. I
                      just wrote a musical and I want to
                      put it on.

                                DEE
                      Well, what’s your angle?

                                CHARLIE
                      I don’t have an angle, Dee. I just
                      wrote a musical and I want you guys
                      to perform in it.

                                DENNIS
                      Against who?

                                CHARLIE
                      It’s not against anyone. I just
                      want to put up a play.

                                MAC
                      Right, but who versus?

                                CHARLIE
                      It’s not versus anybody. I’m not
                      trying to screw anyone here. It’s
                      not a competition. I wrote a
                      musical just to write a musical.
                      Now, if you guys are gonna screw
                      this up for me, I can find other
                      people to play your parts.

                                DEE
                      Whoa, whoa slow down there.

                                DENNIS
                      Yeah, we’re just trying to wrap our
                      heads around this thing.

                                MAC
                      Relax, dude, no one said they
                      didn’t want to do the play.

                                FRANK

        The Gang plus Artemis are all gathered in a small auditorium
        theater. Artemis passes out scripts. They start looking
        through the scripts.

                          Gather around everybody! Alright,

                          kind enough to book this fine local
                          theater for us. She was also good
                          enough to transcribe my work into a
                          format that you all might consider
                          more legible.

                          Or literate. There’s words now.

                          herself into the position of
                          assistant director.

                                    ARTEMIS

                      the Dayman when he defeats the
                      Nightman. That’s you.

                      So Mac plays two roles? That’s not

                                FRANK
                      I’ll do it if I can be nude.                                                          *

                      in the nude.                                                                          *

                      What if I’m covered head to toe in

                                DEE
                      You wrote boy.

                                CHARLIE
                      Man, boy, it’s a metaphor.

                                DEE
                      Well, the audience is gonna think
                      I’m a child molester.

                                MAC
                      I’ve changed my mind. I’m playing
                      the Nightman!

                                        CHARLIE
                      What? No.

                                DENNIS
                      Why would you want to play the
                      Nightman?

                                MAC
                      The Nightman is badass. He has the
                      eyes of a cat and he does karate.

                                CHARLIE
                      Where are you getting that from?

                                DENNIS
                      Alright fine, I’ll play the lead.

                                CHARLIE
                      No, you don’t get to pick which
                      roles you play.

                                MAC
                      -Frank, you got a guy that does cat
                      eyes?

                                CHARLIE
                      Oh for the love of God. Let’s just

        Charlie sits at the piano. Dennis and Dee are on stage. Dee
        wears a work apron and stands on a box. She is reaching out
        towards Dennis as she sings.

                                    DEE
                          Boy, tiny little boy, how I need
                          you. How I love you. Want to touch
                          that little boy.

                                    DENNIS
                          If you only knew what I could do to
                          you...                                                                                *

                                    DEE
                          Tiny baby little baby boy...

        Dee stops singing.

                                    DEE (CONT'D)
                          Stop. Stop. I gotta stop this. What
                          the hell, Charlie?!

        Charlie gets up from behind the piano.

                                    CHARLIE
                          What’s the problem?

                                    DEE
                          Are you kidding me?! Tiny baby
                          little baby boy?!

                                            CHARLIE
                          What?

                                    DEE
                          That makes me look so bad! I’m
                          saying I want to make love to a
                          tiny little baby boy!

                                    CHARLIE
                          I told you, it’s a metaphor, Dee.

                                    DEE
                          You keep saying that, but I don’t
                          think you know what it means. Also
                          it says we make out at the end of
                          the scene, and I’m not going to
                          make out with Dennis.

                                CHARLIE
                      This is why I didn’t think he
                      should play the boy.

                                ARTEMIS
                      What if it’s a sexually charged
                      embrace?                                                                              *

                                CHARLIE
                      Okay you know what? If nobody likes
                      the song, I can cut the song.

                                DENNIS
                      Hold on a second, don’t cut the
                      song. Dee apologize.

                                ARTEMIS
                      I think it’s a bad idea to cut the
                      song, Charlie.

                                CHARLIE
                      Artemis, please. Let me get this.
                      Dennis, take a five.

                                DENNIS
                      I don’t want to cut the song.

                                CHARLIE
                      Dennis, a five... please, a five?

    Dennis walks off.

                                CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                      Alright, Dee. The song is history.

                                DEE
                      Good. What should we replace it
                      with?

                                        CHARLIE
                      Nothing.

                                        DEE
                      Nothing?

                                CHARLIE
                      That’s right. Absolutely nothing.

                                DENNIS
                      Yeah, the blanket does make the rap-
                      excuse me sexing from behind seem
                      more classy.

                                CHARLIE
                      No! No no no no no no nnnoooo! The
                      Nightman always takes you face to
                      face so he can look into your eyes!
                      Then once he’s finished and
                      satisfied we’ll dim the lights to
                      show the audience that the Nightman
                      was able to successfully enter the
                      little boy. Then Dennis, you sneak
                      off stage and when the lights come
                      back up, Mac, I need to be as hard
                      as you can be, because you’re still
                      not satisfied.

        The WAITRESS is walking down the sidewalk. Charlie pops out
        from between two parked cars.

                                            CHARLIE
                          Hey!

                                    WAITRESS
                          Shit. You startled me.

                                    CHARLIE
                          Oh did I? I dropped a little thing
                          down here and...I didn’t even know
                          you walked here. Is this one of
                          your walking places?

                                    WAITRESS
                          Look, I have mace.

                                    CHARLIE
                          Yeah I know all the things that you
                          have. Don’t spray. Oh I just
                          remembered something. Check this
                          out. Funny thing. Looks like I have
                          a free ticket for you to see a
                          musical that I wrote.

        He pulls a ticket out of his pocket and hands it to her.

                                    WAITRESS
                          Wow, thanks. A free ticket to a
                          play I don’t want to see.

                                     CHARLIE
                          I’ve reserved you a seat in the
                          front row.

                                     WAITRESS
                          Look, dude, I’m not going to see
                          your play.

                      Come on! You’re not gonna regret
                      it.

                                WAITRESS
                      Okay, I’m opening the mace.

                                 CHARLIE
                      Wait. Wait. Wait. Let me bargain
                      with you here. If you just come to
                      see this play I won’t ever bother
                      you again.

                                WAITRESS
                      I do not believe that for a second.

                                        CHARLIE
                      Why not?!

                                WAITRESS
                      Are you kidding me! This has been
                      going on for years now! We’ve been
                      through countless restraining
                      orders. I’ve moved three times.
                      I’ve died my hair.

                                CHARLIE
                      I know. I know. I’ve been a bit of
                      a dick but that’s all gonna change
                      if you see this play.

                                WAITRESS
                      You won’t hang around the coffee
                      shop, or follow me home or call me
                      in the middle of the night and
                      pretend to be in a car accident?

                                CHARLIE
                      Yeah. All of that.

                                WAITRESS
                      Fine. Give me the ticket.

                                CHARLIE
                      Great. You’re not gonna regret
                      this.

                                WAITRESS
                      I’m already regretting it.

                                                                                             CUT TO:

        Frank and Mac are peering out into the audience as people
        file in. Frank is covered in hair like Cousin It. Mac is
        wearing all tight black clothing like a gay ninja. He is
        doing Karate warm-up exercises. Dee is in full coffee
        shop/princess garb. She applies make up. Dennis is wearing
        onesy pajamas with the footies. He seems extremely nervous.
        Everyone wears excessive stage make up.

        Mac approaches Charlie who is looking at an empty chair in
        the audience.

                                    MAC
                          Dude, what is the deal? When are we

                          ready to start it.

                          We were supposed to start twenty
                          minutes ago.

                          Alright, screw it. You guys ready?

        Artemis comes backstage as the lights in the theater go to
        black.

                                    FRANK
                              (to Dennis)
                          Let’s go.

                                    DENNIS
                          I’m not ready! I feel sick.                                                           *

        The curtain rises and the lights come up on stage. The set is
        high school play cheap and looks like a troll’s version of
        Charlie’s apartment.

        Frank (The Troll) sits on a chair.

                      “I have an itchy witchy witchy on
                      my toesy woeses. Boy! Come and
                      scratch my itch!”

    Dennis stands still and frozen, looking directly into the
    audience.

                                TROLL
                      I said, “Boy! Come and scratch my
                      itch!”

    Dennis doesn’t react.

                                FRANK
                          (aside to Dennis)

                      toes, you’re making me look like an
                      asshole.

    The audience laughs.

    Dennis snaps out of it and awkwardly comes over to Frank and
    starts scratching his feet.

                                FRANK (CONT'D)
                          (to Dennis)
                      You have a line, idiot.

                                DENNIS/BOY
                      Oh, um, “yes my master. Your toes
                      are, what fine toes it is you
                      are... have. Your toes are... you

                      “That’s enough boy! Do you think my
                      toes are for scratching all day?”

    Dennis is frozen again and looking into the audience.

    Beat.

                                FRANK
                          (feeding Dennis his line)

        Dee waits to make her entrance. Artemis approaches.

                          They’re getting a lot of laughs.

                      “Yeah, he’s sleeping. Just like you
                      like it. You got the toll?”

                                MAC/NIGHTMAN
                      “Confound your lousy toll, Troll
                      Ssssssssssss.”

    The audience laughs again.

                                 MAC/NIGHTMAN (CONT'D)
                          (To himself)
                      Goddammit.

    The song “Troll Toll” begins.

                                TROLL
                      You gotta pay the Troll toll to get
                      into this boy’s hole. You gotta pay
                      the Troll toll to get in. You want
                      this baby boy’s hole, then come and
                      pay this Troll toll. You gotta pay
                      the Troll toll to get in.

    The Nightman is handing a sack of coins to the Troll.

                                NIGHTMAN
                      “Here is your money, Troll.”

                                TROLL
                      “Your boy awaits”.

    Mac starts doing some Karate moves. The audience laughs.

                                NIGHTMAN
                      “Now, the boy’ssss-hole is mine!”

    The lights flash as Gladys plays dramatically at the piano.

                               (to Mac)
                           Jesus Mac, do you actually have a
                           boner right now?

                                     MAC
                           Shut up, you’re ruining it.

         The Waitress seems confused.

         Frank throws a blanket over them and the lights cut to BLACK.
         We clearly see Dennis run off stage.

15       INT. STAGE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT 4)                                                                    15

         Mac addresses the crowd.

                                     MAC
                           Yeah, I’m the Nightman, so what?
                           You think I’m just the bad guy? Big
                           deal. You don’t know me. Let me
                           sing a song I wrote and you’ll
                           understand more better.

         Music starts and Mac begins to sing.

                                     MAC (CONT'D)
                           Some people are born skinny. Some
                           people are born fat. Some people
                           are born evil with the eyes of a
                           cat.

         Mac begins to dance.

                                     MAC (CONT'D)
                           It’s nature shit happens there’s
                           nothing you can do. For what made

         Charlie is putting on stage make up.

         Mac and Dennis square off. The troll is dead on the ground.

                                             NIGHTMAN/MAC
                           “Sssssss.”

                                DENNIS
                      It’s crazy how much better I am
                      than you right now.

                                NIGHTMAN/MAC
                      Just... you can’t. You know what,
                      just skip to the end.

                                DAYMAN/DENNIS
                      Fine. “Because I am your worst

    They Karate fight each other. Dennis chops Mac to death.

    Dee/Princess appears on stage.

                                DEE/PRINCESS
                      You have defeated the evil that was
                      here.

                                DAYMAN/DENNIS
                      Naturally. I am the Dayman.

                                DEE/PRINCESS
                      And now it is just us. And you are
                      now a man and not a boy. I love

                      You’re not supposed to say it.

    There is a musical transition as we see Charlie descending
    from above the stage strapped to a giant sun. He sings:

                                CHARLIE
                      Uhhhhhh-ahhhhhhh. Uhhhhhh-ahhhhhhh.
                      I was that little boy. The little
                      baby boy was me. I once was a baby
                      boy, but now I am a man. I fought
                      the Nightman. Lived as Dayman. Now
                      I’m here to ask for your hand. So
                      if you want to mar-ry, man will you
                      marry me? Will you come on stage
                      and join me? In this thing called

                      not bone me. Please just marry-
                      meeeeeeeeeeee.

    Charlie extends his hand to the reserved seat and a spotlight
    swings to the Waitress’ seat.

                      And my part of the bargain is over,
                      which means I will never ever see
                      you again. Goodbye.
