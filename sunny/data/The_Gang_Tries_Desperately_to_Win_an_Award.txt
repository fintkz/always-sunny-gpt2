        Charlie, Mac, Dennis and Dee argue around the bar.

                                    CHARLIE
                          Why would I wear gloves at work? It
                          makes no sense.

                                    MAC
                          It absolutely makes sense. You’re a
                          janitor who snakes a toilet with
                          his bare hands.

                                    CHARLIE
                          So my hands get a little dirty. I
                          appreciate the concern but I’m
                          fine.

                                    MAC
                          It’s not for you, it’s for us. To
                          protect us from your hands which
                          are now fully immersed in our ice.

                                    CHARLIE
                          Well, this is to cool the cuts I
                          got from cutting the lemons.

                                    DEE
                          Jesus Christ. Wear gloves!

        They descend into yelling. Frank walks in, carrying a
        NEWSPAPER. He tries to stop the argument.

                                 FRANK
                      Hold up! Ho!
                          (then)
                      Check this out. The Bar
                      Association’s best bar award is
                      coming up. We could get nominated.

                                MAC
                      Frank. We never get nominated for
                      awards. They’re stupid. We don’t
                      care about that shit.

                                 DENNIS
                      No we do not.
                          (then)
                      Am I curious why we’re never
                      nominated? Sure. Do I care? Not in
                      the slightest.

                                CHARLIE
                      Yeah, we don’t care... but it is
                      odd that we get no recognition.

                                DEE
                      It seems aggressive.

                                FRANK
                      You should care. It’s good for
                      business. You can make more money.

                                CHARLIE
                      Frank, we don’t care about money.
                      That’s not why we do this.

                                DEE
                      That’s why I do it.

                                DENNIS/MAC
                      Me too./ I want money.

                                FRANK
                      So, what is it then? You don’t
                      think we deserve it? You don’t
                      think we’re cool enough?

    A beat of stubborn silence. Then:

                                MAC
                      ‘Course it’s cool enough. Why would
                      I do something that isn’t cool?

                                DENNIS
                      If I’m gonna put my name on
                      something, it’ll be award-worthy.

                                 DEE
                      I can’t imagine others do what we
                      do that much better. It’s just
                      serving up drinks. Serving a series
                      of drinks.

                                CHARLIE
                      Now I’m getting upset that we don’t
                      have an award.

                                FRANK
                      You wanna get nominated, you gotta
                      play the game.

                                DENNIS
                      That’s not our style. It’s lame.

                                FRANK
                      You know what’s lame? Being around
                      this long and never getting an
                      award. You look like a buncha
                      assholes.

                                CHARLIE
                      We are not assholes! We’re the
                      best. Ya know what, screw it. Let’s
                      play the game. Let’s win that
                      award!

                                MAC/DEE
                      Screw it./ Let’s do it!

    They all look at one another, shrugging in agreement.

                                DENNIS
                      Fine. Let’s do it. But, I want to
                      be very clear: this literally means
                      nothing to me.

        The gang sit in the office of the Restaurant and Bar
        Association, waiting for the meeting to start.

                                    DEE
                          This office is stuffy.

                                    DENNIS
                          The Restaurant and Bar Association
                          is a stuffy organization. They’re
                          not in touch with young people like
                          us.

                                    DEE
                          Uch. If some old guy gives me
                          attitude, I’m gonna spit in his
                          face.

                                    MAC
                          Give me a cue and we can spit at
                          the same time.

                                    CHARLIE
                          Let’s all spit.

                                    FRANK
                          No one’s spitting. We gotta take
                          ‘em to lunch. Charm them over a
                          shrimp salad. Then we slip ‘em this
                          briefcase full of cash.

                                    CHARLIE
                          Right, right. And when do I show
                          him these pictures of our toilets?

                                    FRANK
                          You don’t. Just let me do the
                          talking. I know what I’m doing.

        An OLDER MAN enters, this is the Restaurant and Bar REP.

                      With much dignity and grace, we’re
                      here to talk about the best bar
                      award. In the past, we weren’t able

                      attention. But I assure you we are

                                FRANK
                      Perhaps we can go talk about this
                      matter over some lettuce and shrimp?

                      Let’s get out of here. We don’t
                      need some limp-dicked old man
                      telling us if our bar is cool.

    Dee begins to HOCK A LOOGIE. Mac, on cue, begins to HOCK.

                                FRANK
                      No spitting!
                          (to Rep)
                      Look, how much is it gonna take to
                      get us on the ballot?

                                REP
                      Ten dollars.

                                        FRANK
                      Huh?

                                REP
                      The entry fee is ten dollars. All
                      you have to do is fill out a form
                      and pay the fee. We send it to all
                      members.

                                MAC
                      We’re already members?!

                                FRANK
                      Well, why haven’t we ever received
                      the form?

                                REP
                      We’ve actually sent you the form
                      many times in the past, and as I
                      recall, they always come back
                      covered in fecal matter, urine and
                      racial slurs. One year, I believe
                      you incorporated a used tampon.

                                DEE
                      Well, that could’ve been anyone. I
                      mean...

                                DENNIS
                      People steal the mail and do weird
                      things to it.

                                    FRANK
                          Either way, we’re on board now.
                          We’re ready to play the game. I
                          assume you take cash?

        Frank opens the briefcase and BOOM! BLUE PAINT EXPLODES all
        over his face.

                                    DEE
                          Uhp, sorry. We put a dye pack in
                          there. That was meant for you.

                                    MAC
                          We thought that you would think
                          that was funny.

                                    DENNIS
                          But, I can tell from your reaction
                          that’s not your style. And we get
                          that now.

                                     CHARLIE
                          There’s one more in there. Lemme
                          grab that.

        Charlie pops it in his mouth. It EXPLODES silently. Charlie
        smiles, a mouth of blue.

        The gang laughs.

                                    DEE
                          That was funny!

                                    MAC
                              (to the Rep)
                          You don’t think that’s funny?

                                    CHARLIE
                          Thank you for letting us
                          participate.

        The gang walks to the Range Rover. Frank’s face is smeared
        with remnants of the blue paint. Charlie’s mouth, the same.

                                    FRANK
                          What’d I say, idiots? You wanna get
                          nominated, you gotta play the game.

                                CHARLIE
                      We were playing. We just weren’t
                      vibing with that dude.

                                 DEE
                      It’s just a different level of
                      vibration.

                                DENNIS
                      Frank’s right. We’re too fringe.
                      It’s given us a lot of street cred,
                      but it’s also alienated a lotta
                      people.

                                FRANK
                      Look, if you wanna win, you gotta
                      campaign for it. It’s an industry
                      award, voted on by the industry.
                      We should pop around to some other
                      bars. Get our name out there.

                                DENNIS
                      Right. We know we’re cool but other
                      people don’t.

                                DEE
                      We’re the best kept secret in
                      Philadelphia. Time to let that
                      secret out.

                                CHARLIE
                      Great, and while you guys do that,
                      I’ll get to work on the song.

                                        FRANK
                      What song?

                                CHARLIE
                      Ya know, the best song award.

                                MAC
                      There’s no best song award, dude.

                                CHARLIE
                      Well, then all the more reason. We
                      do songs all the time. Could be our
                      best shot at winning. Let’s cover
                      all of our bases.

                          That’s not a base. That base does
                          not exist in the game.

4       INT. SUDZ BAR - NIGHT (N1)                         **COORS LIGHT PLACEMENT**                            4

        Mac, Dennis, Dee and Frank walk into SUDZ BAR. It’s
        everything Paddy’s is not: bright, colorful and filled with
        people. (LOUD POP MUSIC plays in the background.) The guys
        are not impressed.

                                    MAC
                          I can’t believe this place has won
                          best bar. Who goes here?

                                    FRANK
                          A shitload of people. Sudz is super
                          popular.

                                    DENNIS
                          I don’t care for how bright it is
                          in here.

                                    MAC
                          And all the loud music and loud
                          colors. Where’s the subtlety?

                                    DEE
                          I’d like to mail some tampons to
                          this place, ya know?

                                    DENNIS
                          We all would, but that’s not gonna
                          win us any awards. Let’s order a
                          drink. Sniff out the competition.

                                    FRANK
                          And I’m gonna go introduce myself
                          to the manager. Give ‘em the goodie
                          bag.

                                FRANK
                          (shrugs)
                      Stuff I had our name printed on.
                      Key chain, bottle opener, egg.

    Frank pulls out an EGG with “Paddy’s Pub” printed on it.

                                DEE
                      Why would you put an egg in there?

                                FRANK
                      It’s like for a paperweight. People
                      eat this shit up. Trust me, this is
                      how you play the game.

    Frank unzips his sweatshirt to REVEAL a PADDY’S PUB T-SHIRT.

    A decent-looking bartender GREG (late 20s, think Josh
    Cooke/Josh Radnor) walks up to Dee, Mac and Dennis.

                                GREG
                      Hey there, guys. I’m Greg, I’ll be
                      your bartender tonight. You ever
                      been to Sudz before?

                                MAC/DEE/DENNIS
                      Pfft./ You wish./ Don’t think so,
                      pal.

                                GREG
                      Welcome, then. I like to recommend
                      to first timers our signature
                      blended cocktail, the Blue Hole.
                      Served with three straws in a fish
                      bowl. It’s pretty darn good. Some
                      say it’s better than an orgasm.

    An African American bartender, MAXWELL (late 20s), walks by
    behind him, with a perfectly timed quip.

                                MAXWELL
                      Not that he’s ever had one.

    LAUGHTER from other customers sitting at the bar. The gang
    looks confused.

                                GREG
                      Thanks, Maxwell. Remind me to get a
                      new best friend.

    More laughter from the customers. Greg and Maxwell laugh
    playfully. AMANDA, a very cute waitress, walks up, clearly
    upset.

                                AMANDA
                      Two margaritas for table six, Greg.

                                GREG
                      What’s wrong, Amanda? Lemme guess,
                      boyfriend cancelled on you again.

                                AMANDA
                      Conference got extended. What can I
                      say? He loves his work.

                                GREG
                      Well, he should spend a little less
                      time on his work and a little more
                      time on you.

    The customers “Awwww.”

                                AMANDA
                      Thanks. You’re sweet.

    She heads off. Greg turns back to the gang.

                                GREG
                      Sorry ‘bout that. So, one Blue
                      Hole.

                                DENNIS
                      Well, there’s three of us. So three
                      drinks.

                                GREG
                      Uh, well, they’re generally shared
                      because they’re pretty big--

                                DEE
                      He said three, bozo.

    Greg nods and heads off.

                                DENNIS

                      Me neither, too soft. This is
                      Philadelphia. I want a bartender
                      with a little edge.

                      We’re aggressive. We tend to come
                      at the customer hard. I like that.

                                DENNIS
                      And what’s up with the black friend
                      no one is acknowledging is black?
                      It’s odd that no one’s talking
                      about that.

                                MAC
                      We’d make a thing of it. Address
                      the social and cultural aspects of
                      diversity head on.

    Greg and Maxwell come back with THREE BLUE HOLES.

                                GREG
                      Here you guys go.

    Maxwell RINGS the bell. Everyone starts drinking.

                                MAXWELL
                      Ho! Drink up!

                                MAC
                      What the hell’s that?

                                GREG
                      Sudz alert. When we ring the bell,
                      then everyone has to drink.

    Greg heads off.

                                MAC
                      I don’t need someone telling me
                      when to drink. I’ll drink when I’m
                      goddamn thirsty.

                                 DENNIS
                      Yeah!
                          (then)
                      That said, it would’ve been fun to
                      drink when everyone else was
                      drinking.

    They all DRINK.

5       INT. SUDZ BAR - MANAGER’S OFFICE - SAME TIME (N1)                                                       5

        Frank’s poking around an empty office. He sticks his hand in
        a CANDY JAR on the desk (a la Tom Lofaro).

                                    SUDZ MANAGER
                          What are you doing in my office?

                                    FRANK
                          Ah! You snuck up on me there.
                              (upbeat)
                          Frank Reynolds. Owner of Paddy’s
                          Pub. I wanted to stop by and
                          introduce myself. Oh here. Little
                          goodie bag for ya.

        He hands the manager the goodie bag. The Manager examines it.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                          Just some knick-knacks I thought
                          you might enjoy.

                                    SUDZ MANAGER
                          There’s a broken egg in here.

                                    FRANK
                          Huh? Ah shit. That wasn’t one of
                          the boiled ones? My bad. Want me to
                          cook that up for ya?

                                    SUDZ MANAGER
                          What do you want?

                                    FRANK
                          Your vote. For the best bar award.
                          You probably never heard of Paddy’s
                          Pub, but we’re the best kept secret
                          in Philadelphia.

                                    SUDZ MANAGER
                          I’ve been there once. The
                          bartenders were all just yelling at
                          one another. Then they ran off to
                          sneak into a museum or something. I
                          couldn’t follow it. Never even got
                          served a drink.

                                     FRANK
                              (to himself)
                          Goddamnit.

                                    SUDZ MANAGER
                          Please don’t say that.

                                            FRANK
                          Huh?

                                    SUDZ MANAGER
                          I find that word offensive.

                                    FRANK
                          What, damnit?

                                    SUDZ MANAGER
                          No, the God part.

                                    FRANK
                          How do you know I’m damning your
                          God? Maybe I’m damning a God you
                          don’t believe in. If I said Zeus
                          Damnit, would you be upset?
                          Whatever. I’m out of here.

        Dee, Mac and Dennis finish off their drinks. Dee BELCHES.

                                    DEE
                          Whoo. Went down easy. I gotta say:
                          I like the drink.

                                    MAC
                          I like this place. I feel
                          comfortable here. I haven’t looked
                          over my shoulder once, wondering if
                          someone’s coming at me.

                                    DENNIS
                          It’s growing on me. The staff has
                          great chemistry. Did you see that
                          charged moment between Amanda and
                          Greg? She has a boyfriend but I
                          think her and Greg could get
                          together. I’d like to come back and
                          see how it plays out.

                                    MAC
                          Well, I for one hope he gets her.
                          ‘Cause that chick is smoking.

                                DEE
                      So? Bet she can’t tell a joke.

                                DENNIS
                      She doesn’t have to tell jokes,
                      Dee. She’s pretty. And if she can
                      tell jokes... even better.

    Frank walks up, agitated.

                                FRANK
                      Let’s get outta this dump.

                                DENNIS
                      This place isn’t a dump, Frank.
                      It’s actually pretty great here.

                                FRANK
                      Well, I got news for you: our
                      secret’s out and it stinks. The
                      manager’s been to our bar and hated
                      it. Said it was just a bunch a
                      people yelling over one another.

                                DEE
                      That’s what we do. We argue with
                      each other and if they want to
                      listen, they’re welcome to.

                                DENNIS
                      I’m realizing that’s off-putting to
                      the customer. Greg would never yell
                      at Amanda. Never.

    Maxwell RINGS THE BELL.

                                MAC/DEE/DENNIS
                      Ho!!!/ Time to drink.

    They all drink. Frank’s confused.

                                FRANK
                      What the hell’s that?

                                DEE
                      The bell tells you when to drink.

                                MAC
                      I’m into the bell now. It puts me
                      at ease ‘cause I’m not worried
                      about when I have to drink next.

                          should host an industry night.

                          Brighter lights would be good. It’s
                          super dark in our bar.

7       INT. PADDY’S PUB - THE NEXT DAY (D2)**COORS LIGHT PLACEMENT** 7

        Dennis, Mac and Dee are around the bar.

                                    DENNIS
                          If we’re gonna show these industry
                          folks tonight that we’re likeable,
                          we need to have some funny banter
                          like Greg and Maxwell had.

                                    DEE
                          Don’t worry, I’ll be zinging one-
                          liners left and right.

                          Actually, you won’t, Dee. A funny
                          girl intimidates men. Pretty and

                      Right, but the customers want you
                      to be together. It’s fun for them.

                                DEE
                      How is it fun to watch two people
                      who don’t wanna be together?

                                DENNIS
                      No, see-- you do wanna be together.
                      The customer has to think that you
                      think you don’t wanna be together,
                      but deep down you do wanna be
                      together. The problem is, right now
                      you guys don’t wanna be together.
                      And you need to ultimately want to
                      be together.

                      Question.

                                DENNIS
                      You’re wondering how we’re gonna
                      make Dee attractive.

                                        MAC
                      Yes.

                                DENNIS
                      We’ll shellack her with makeup and
                      light the shit out of her. Soften her
                      face up.

                                DEE
                      I like that.

                                DENNIS
                      I knew you would. Great. Now let’s
                      go over our banter.

                      Mac’s gonna welcome the customer
                      and then I’m gonna come in and
                      execute with a quip. Give it a try.

                                MAC
                          (reading)
                      Hey, I’m Mac. Welcome to Paddy’s
                      Pub. I like to recommend to first
                      timers our signature blended drink,
                      Caribbean Paradise. People say it’s
                      better than an orgasm.

                                DENNIS
                      Not that he’s ever had one.

                                MAC
                      Bullshit! Bullshit! I had one with
                      your mom! I’ll kill you, Dennis!
                      I’ll kill you!

                                DENNIS
                      Whoa! Whoa! Stop. Stop. Mac, what
                      were you doing?

                                MAC
                      You insulted me so I faced you.

                                DENNIS
                      That’s how we normally talk. It’s
                      too aggressive. People don’t wanna
                      be around that. Learn those lines
                      so it feels off the cuff.

                                DEE
                      Yeah, and she didn’t even notice.

                                        DENNIS
                      What?

                                DEE
                      That’s the punch line to Mac
                      banging our mom.

                                DENNIS
                      Your timing is terrible. No jokes
                      from you. Look, settle into your
                      new roles. Mac, keep it playful.
                      Dee, pretty and dumb. Will they or
                      won’t they. Keep it light.

    Frank runs in.

                                FRANK
                      Change of plans! Change of plans!
                      We gotta go darker with industry
                      night. Edgier.

                                DENNIS
                      Frank, don’t derail us. We’re doing
                      bright lights and bright colors and
                      funny banter. That’s what wins.

                                FRANK
                      Wrong. Artemis and I went to a
                      burlesque bar last night. Women
                      were stripping but it was like,
                      classy. Dimly lit, they were
                      serving martinis. Wasn’t a lotta
                      people there, but this place has
                      won a shitload of awards.

                                MAC
                      So you wanna do a strip club thing?

                                FRANK
                      Nah, stripping-- that’s just to get
                      your rocks off. You don’t get off
                      on burlesque. It works on a much
                      deeper level. It’s about teasing
                      skin and period costumes and
                      artistry. Tasteful.

                                MAC
                      Well, now I’m confused what wins.
                      We’ve certainly worn our fair share
                      of costumes in the bar and Frank’s
                      nude all the time.

                                DENNIS
                      Well, that’s not tasteful nudity.

                                DEE
                      I had a period in one of those
                      dresses.

                                DENNIS
                      Dee, no. Keep it light. That’s your
                      third period joke. Stop.

                      You think the problem is our
                      location?

                                DENNIS
                      There was a bar that just opened
                      down the street last year and they
                      instantly won an award.

                                FRANK
                      ...Is it us?

    A beat.

                                DENNIS/MAC/DEE
                      No way./ It’s not us./ It’s them.

                                FRANK
                      Let Artemis do a burlesque thing
                      off to the side. It’ll be darkly
                      lit and we’ll have champagne. Sexy
                      and edgy, but with some class.

                                MAC
                      Might be good to spread our bets.
                      Since we don’t know what works.

                                DEE
                      It does all seem very arbitrary.

                                DENNIS
                      Fine, but do it in the back office.
                      And please... keep it classy.

    Charlie runs in.

                                CHARLIE
                      Alright! I got it!

                                        DEE
                      Got what?

                                CHARLIE
                      Best song. I’ve been off writing a
                      song. Where do you think I’ve been
                      all this time? C’mon, get with the
                      program.

                                DENNIS

                      C’mon, I think you’re really gonna

                      Yes! Play the song! Please! We’re
                      all clamoring!

    CHARLIE begins to play his song. It’s Randy Newman-esque.

                                CHARLIE
                      It’s good to be me.
                      It’s good to be you.
                      We’re as unique as pelican stew.

                      When you win first place,
                      But why do we have to even be in a race?

                      Why can’t we all love one another?
                      Helping our friends and loving thy
                      brother.
                      I’m talking ‘bout love, love, love
                      love, love.
                      Talking ‘bout love, love, love,
                      love, love.

                      Wouldn’t that be great?

    Charlie finishes his catchy tune. The gang takes it in.

                      That was... great!

                      Totally. There was nothing about

        Industry night. People are coming into the bar. Bright
        lights, loud music. Mac and Dennis are by the bar.

                                    DENNIS
                          People are arriving. Now remember,
                          when a customer comes up, keep it

                      That’s... great, Z. Thank you.

    Z sips a cocktail drink through a swirly straw.

                                DENNIS
                      Kinda wish we had a less intense
                      black guy for diversity. Maybe we
                      should throw another one into the
                      mix, just to counter Z’s vibe.

                                MAC
                      Noo, we gotta be careful about the
                      ratio. You got too many black guys,
                      then it feels like a black bar.
                      That’s gonna hurt our chances.

                                DENNIS
                      It didn’t seem to me like the black
                      bars ever win awards.

                                MAC
                      I feel like we have said the word
                      black too many times already.

                                DENNIS
                      I’m with you. It’s not light. It
                      doesn’t feel playful.

                                DEE (O.S.)
                      Loving this light over here.

    ANGLE ON Dee, who’s in a SOFT-FOCUSED SHOT, LIKE BARBARA
    STREISAND.

                                DEE (CONT'D)
                      I’m glowing like an angel. I look
                      great. Now I don’t feel the need to
                      be funny. I can just be beautiful.

    An OLDER FEMALE CUSTOMER walks up.

                                FEMALE CUSTOMER
                      Hi, can I get a drink?

                                MAC
                      Hey there! I’m Mac. Welcome to
                      Paddy’s Pub. I like to recommend to
                      first timers our signature blended
                      drink, Caribbean Paradise. People
                      say it’s better than bustin’ a nut.

                      Excuse me?

                                MAC
                      Busting a nut. It’s like... blowing
                      a load.
                          (re: Dennis)
                      It’s a funny joke. He said it was
                      funny.

    Dennis runs up.

                                DENNIS
                      Well, hold on....

                                MAC
                      It’s like cumming all over
                      somebody. It’s playful, it’s light.

                                DENNIS
                          (all through SMILES)
                      I think he’s just trying to refer
                      to an orgasm. Accidentally, he got
                      a little too specific.

                                MAC
                      Sorry, the drinks are good. We
                      orgasm in them. I forget the next
                      line.
                          (calling out)
                      Line!

                                DENNIS
                      Off the cuff, Mac. What can I get
                      you to drink, ma’am?

    Dee steps out of her light.

                                DEE
                      Not like you ever had one, Mac.

                                DENNIS
                      Too late, Dee. Back in your light.

    Frank walks up and grabs champagne.

                                FRANK
                      Yo. We’re all set up. Dee, help me
                      bring some champagne back there.

                           On it.

         Dee steps out of the light, revealing her makeup again.

                                     DENNIS
                           Stay in the light! I got this.
                               (to Dee and Mac)
                           Do the charged moment. Please.

                                                                                                  CUT TO:

9        INT. PADDY’S PUB - BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER (N2)                                                     9

         Frank and Dennis take in the converted back office, covered
         in dark fabrics, velvet, etc. It looks like an antique parlor
         for Parisian burlesque. It’s strangely classy.

                                     DENNIS
                           Huh. Not bad, Frank. Good work.

                                     FRANK
                           I told ya. It’s real lavish.
                           Tasteful.

         ARTEMIS walks up to Dennis. She’s dressed in a period costume,
         carrying a plume of feathers.

                                     ARTEMIS
                           Care for a show?

         Her plume of feathers jabs into Dennis’ face. Artemis starts
         a burlesque dance to music. Frank’s into it.

                                     FRANK
                           Yeah. Tease ‘em. Now do the thing
                           with the shoulder-- good, good.

                                                                                                BACK TO:

10       INT. PADDY’S PUB - CONTINUOUS (N2) **COORS LIGHT PLACEMENT** 10

         The Sudz Manager and the Bar/Restaurant REP stand by the bar,
         drinking. Mac and Dee play it up in front of them. Dee SIGHS
         loudly.

                                     MAC
                           What’s wrong, Dee?

                                     DEE

                      doesn’t know what he has.
                          (to customer)
                      You should see this guy. Real ugly.

                                SUDZ MANAGER
                      I’m sorry, are you talking to me?

                                 MAC
                      I said her boyfriend’s ugly. Pay
                      attention.

                                DEE
                      Ugly?! My boyfriend wouldn’t be
                      ugly.

                                MAC
                      He’s a tool.

                                DEE
                      Oh, is he?! I’m sorry if he can’t
                      be like you and have ridiculous
                      tattoos and a cigarette for a
                      mother!

                                MAC
                      Don’t insult my mom! I’ll beat your
                      face in, you stupid bitch.

    Mac and Dee SLAP FIGHT each other, sloppily.

                                DENNIS
                      Hey! Whoa, what’s going on?

                                REP
                      This guy is trying to hit that
                      woman.

                                MAC
                      I woulda punched her if I could’ve
                      gotten an angle. She’s hiding
                      behind the blender.

                                DENNIS
                      This is not, ‘will they or won’t

                                SUDZ MANAGER
                      Excuse me, there’s a guy climbing
                      through your floor?

    REVEAL Charlie, now greasy, climbing through a floor vent.

                                 MAC
                      It’s fine. That’s just our janitor.
                          (then)
                      Goddamnit, Charlie. You’re scaring

                      covered in grease.

                      Told ya, you guys, you cou--
                      couldn’t keep me out.

                                DENNIS
                      Are you high?

                                CHARLIE
                      I’m very high. You locked me in
                      a-- in a basement filled with spray
                      paint. Came up with a whole new
                      song, though. I’ll play it for
                      everyone.

                                DENNIS
                      You’re not playing anything!

                                MAC
                      You’re yelling.

                          (calmly)

                      Uhp, I think Z invited friends.

    ON SEVERAL BLACK GANGBANGER DUDES walking in. Z greets them.

                                MAC
                      That is too many black people, dude.
                      The ratio is off. The ratio is off!

                      It’s getting intense in here. Crank

                           Yes. Of course.
                               (to Rep)
                           Gentlemen, how about something a
                           little more upscale.

         Dennis, Dee, and Mac lead the Rep and the Sudz Manager to the
         back office.

                                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
                           Back here I think you’ll find it
                           very sexy but very tasteful.

11       INT. PADDY’S PUB - OUTSIDE BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS (N2)                                                11

         Dennis opens the door and everyone reacts, shocked, to what
         they see off-screen. We can hear Frank grunting.

                                     FRANK (O.S.)
                           This is art!!!!!!

                                     MAC
                           This is bad.

         Suddenly, the LIGHTS DIM and music begins to play. Everyone
         turns to see Charlie on piano, playing something akin to the
         slow beginning of “Bohemian Rhapsody” or an epic Bowie song.

                                     CHARLIE
                           A spider crawls inside my brain.
                           I think this whole world’s gone
                           insane.
                           But we’re not just here to complain.
                           I’m only here to say one thing.

         Charlie breaks out into aggressive chords, yelling:

                                     CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                           GET OUT! GET OUT OF OUR BAR! YOU
                           CAN EAT MY SHIT AND MY BALLS! I SAY
                           GO SCREW YOU ALL, GO SCREW
                           YOURSELVES!

         Charlie starts spitting and singing “GET OUT!”

                      He’s spitting. He’s spitting on
                      them.

                                MAC

    Mac then SPITS AT THEM. THEY ALL START TO SPIT.

                                REP
                      Ah! What’s wrong with you people?

    It’s a commotion. The gang yells, hisses, and spits as
    EVERYONE RUNS OUT. Then, they’re alone.

                                CHARLIE
                      So? You guys like the song?

                                FRANK

                      Definitely not gonna win an award
                      now.

                                DENNIS
                      So... I guess it is us after all.

                                GANG
                      Oh yeah./ It’s us./ Been us the

                      Yeah./ Screw them./ Paddy’s rules.

    A beat of reflection. Then:

                                DENNIS
                      I really wanted that award.

                                GANG
                      Yeah. / That would have been nice.

                                                                                 FADE TO BLACK.
