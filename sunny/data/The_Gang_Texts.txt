                 DENNIS and DEE wait outside the Zoo.

                                                 DENNIS
                                   Damnit, where is Frank? I am not
                                   missing that lion feeding.

                 REVEAL MAC and CHARLIE wearing matching meerkat hats.

                                                 CHARLIE
                                   The lions are cool but the
                                   meerkats is the best exhibit.

                                                 MAC
                                   They got those bubble things where
                                   you can pop your head up and look
                                   around. It’s like you’re a
                                   meerkat.

                                                 DENNIS
                                   I’m not waiting for Frank. I’m
                                   going in.

                                                 DEE
                                   I think we should stick together.
                                   We don’t want anyone getting lost.
                                   People just vanish in the crowds
                                   at the Zoo and then bad things
                                   happen.

                                                 DENNIS
                                   Calm down, Dee.
                                        (explaining)
                                   She got lost at the Zoo when she
                                   was seven.

                                                 DEE
                                   And I almost got trampled to death
                                   by wild animals.

                                                 DENNIS
                                   Sheep! At the petting Zoo!

                                                 MAC
                                   Well, Dee, don’t worry. Modern
                                   technology has solved this problem
                                   for us. We are all connected now.

                                               MAC (CONT'D)
                                 I created a group chat for today,
                                 so we can stay in constant
                                 communication. See, watch this,
                                 I’ll text Frank to see what’s up.

               Mac texts Frank: Where r u?

                                               MAC
                                 So nobody will get lost, we’ll be
                                 able to stick together because the
                                 texting will keep us all on the
                                 same page.

               Frank texts back: FIVE MIN AWAY

                                               MAC
                                 See? He’s only five away.

                                               DENNIS
                                 No he’s not. Everyone knows that
                                 “five min away” actually means
                                 twenty minutes away. I will not
                                 miss this feeding.

                                               CHARLIE
                                 What’s the big deal about watching
                                 a lion eat a pile of dead meat?

                                               DENNIS
                                 Dead? No. No. Quite alive. I
                                 assure you. This is a live
                                 feeding.

                                               CHARLIE
                                 What? Zoos do that?

                                               DENNIS
                                 Yes, indeed they do. That’s why
                                 we’re here today. We will get to
                                 see the kill firsthand. The
                                 sounds, the smells, the screams as
                                 the innocent life is extinguished,
                                 not quickly -- but slowly because
                                 the king of the beasts savors
                                 every moment of this desecration.

               Dee texts: “Dennis has a                       .”

                                               MAC
                                 “Dennis has an eggplant?”
                                                                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                 Well it went away.

                                               DENNIS
                                 I did. It went away.

                                 Dee, don’t abuse the group text.
                                 That’s not what it’s for.

                                               DEE
                                 I was just being funny. I’ll be
                                 like the funny texter.

                                 Do we have to do the texting
                                 thing? I’m already finding Dee
                                 annoying.

                                               DENNIS
                                 She’s always annoying. That’s why
                                 we ditched her when she was seven.

                                               DEE
                                 You ditched me!?

                                 I’m not waiting. I’m going in.

               Dennis starts to exit. Dee follows.

                 Mac nods then texts to group: “Couldn’t hear you. We’ll
                 text you when he gets hear.”

                 Then -- “HERE! Ha!”

                 Dennis turns back to Mac. He’s waving. Dennis sighs and
                 goes through the turnstile.

                                   I hate all this texting. The
                                   Meerkat doesn’t need to text. It
                                   just pops its head out of its hole
                                   and looks around and once the
                                   entire gang has locked eyes they
                                   know they’re good. That’s a real

                                   They humiliate the weak one.
                                   That’s what makes them so funny.

                                   plenty of time.

                                   Oh, the Lion is enjoying his meal.

                                                 DENNIS
                                   The kill? Where’s the kill?

                                   Oh. Sorry sir. You just missed it.

                                                 DENNIS
                                   No. No. You said you’re “five
                                   minutes out”.

                                                            ZOO WORKER

                                   That was only ten minutes ago.

                                                            ZOO WORKER
                                   Correct.

                                   twenty! God damnit!

                 Mac, Frank, and Charlie walk along a Zoo path. Mac stops
                 when he gets Dennis’ text.

                                                 MAC
                                   Oh he’s thanking us for something.
                                   That’s good.

                                    feeding and now he thinks it’s our
                                    fault.

                                    you don’t know how texting works?

                                    Okay. This is just a little
                                    misunderstanding over the sea lion
                                    thing. I know how to handle this.
                                    Just gotta speak from the heart.

                  Dennis looks at the text chain. The three bubbles that
                  indicate someone is writing something are under Mac’s
                  name. It’s taking a beat. Dee stands with Dennis.                                                        *

                  Suddenly, a 27-line response pops up on the screen.

                                    It’ll probably take Dennis a
                                    little while to process all that
                                    and respond thoughtfully.

                                 I didn’t use the word. I used the
                                 picture.

                                 Doesn’t matter. It’s offensive and
                                 off-putting. If you have to go

                                 It works on both levels. It says

                  Dennis moves briskly away. Dee tries to keep up. Dennis
                  makes his way into a crowd.

                                                  DEE
                                    Dennis? Hold up a sec.

                  When Dee pushes through the crowd, she can’t find him.
                  He’s vanished. She looks around, panicked.

                  Frank, Mac, and Charlie walk down a path.

                                    Dee.

                  Charlie goes to high-five Mac. Mac looks at his phone.

                                                  CHARLIE
                                    Come on man. That was a great

                                 sacrificed. I overheard an
                                 employee in here talking about it.
                                 I offered to blow him but he

                  Frank suddenly sees A MONKEY pulling his Bag of Bananas
                  in through the bars.

                                                  FRANK

                  The Monkey takes the bag to another area in the habitat
                  behind a pane of plexiglass. Frank spots this and begins
                  banging on the glass.

                  The Monkey eats the bananas. We see Frank from the
                  Monkey’s Point Of View. We can’t make out his words from
                  behind the glass, so he just comes across like an angry
                  gorilla pounding and hollering.

                  Charlie approaches. He spots Dee alone and backs off
                  before she can see him.

                  IN A SIDE TEXT, Charlie to Dee: “U A LON?”

                  Dee looks at her phone in an odd way again. She texts:

                                                  ZOO WORKER (CONT'D)
                                    This is the petting zoo. We are
                                    going to be feeding the goats.

                  The Zoo Worker hands him a cup full of pellets and walks
                  away. Dennis turns towards Mac enraged.

                                                             MAC
                                    Denni--

                                                  DENNIS
                                    It’s fine. It’s fine, Mac. This is
                                    totally fine. Let’s go to the next
                                    exhibit.

                  Dennis crosses off. Mac follows.

                                                  MAC
                                    Oh cool. I thought you’d be --

                  Dennis approaches a crowd. He turns back towards Mac and
                  looks at him square in the eye. Then backs into the crowd
                  disappearing.

                                                  MAC
                                    Dennis! Dennis!

                  Mac gets to the end of the crowd and Dennis is gone. Like
                  a ghost.

     19           EXT. LARGE PEN/PETTING ZOO - MOMENTS LATER (D1)                                                     19 *

                  Dee wanders around the pen staring at her phone. Then
                  stops directly in the center. She looks around then
                  texts: “At pin. No 1 here. Freaking out. Hello? Hello?”

                  Zoo Worker walks up and hands her a big cup of pellets.

                                                  ZOO WORKER
                                    Here you go, ma’am. Have fun!

                                                  DEE
                                    Huh? What’s this for?

                                                  ZOO WORKER
                                    Okay kids! Let’s go!

                  A gate is open and a sea of animals pour into the pen.
                  The kids cheer. Dee whips around frantically. She sees: A
                  GOAT WITH WONKY EYES.

                                                                                                    (CONTINUED)

                  From the Goat’s POV -- it sees Dee and charges! Dee is
                  frozen with fear as the goat knocks her to the ground.
                  Her pellets spill all over her. Sensing a feeding frenzy,
                  all the goats and sheep swarm as Dee is lost in a sea of
                  animals a la a Game of Thrones battle.

     20           EXT. ZOO PATH - LATER (D1)                                                                          20

                  Mac wanders. He texts: “Guys we all got off course. Just
                  miscommunication. Can fix this. Meet up?”

                  Dennis texts: “H8 U”

                  Dennis has left the conversation. Then --

                  Mac texts: Charlie, Frank, Dee?

                  Frank texts: “Broke hands hurts 2 txt”

                  Frank has left the conversation. Then --

                  Mac texts: “Dee, Charlie”

                  Dee texts: “F U Mac and F                          .”                                                    *

                  Dee has left the conversation.

                  Mac texts: Charlie?

                  The bubbles pop up but then go away.

                  Charlie has left the conversation.

                  He hangs up and puts the phone in his pocket.

     21           EXT. MEERKAT EXHIBIT - ENTRANCE - LATER (D1)                                                        21 *

                  A sullen Mac approaches the Meerkat exhibit. He looks
                  around. Nobody. He looks at his phone. Nothing.

     22           EXT. MEERKAT EXHIBIT - MOMENTS LATER (D1)                                                           22 *

                  Mac’s head pops up in the observation bubble. A Meerkat
                  stares back at Mac from outside the bubble. This makes
                  Mac smile wistfully.

                  The Meerkat drops down revealing Dennis in another
                  observation bubble. He locks eyes with Mac like a deer in
                  headlights. Mac turns and spots Frank in yet another
                  bubble with the same Meerkat-like expression.
                                                                 (CONTINUED)

                  He turns again and discovers Dee popping up and locking
                  eyes with Mac as well. He turns one last time and there’s
                  Charlie staring back at Mac with a confident smile as if
                  to say “I told you, this is what it’s all about.”

                  The Gang exits the exhibit in great spirits.

                                                  MAC
                                    That was amazing!

                                                  FRANK
                                    I knew what you were all saying
                                    just by the looks on your faces.

                                                  DEE
                                    I felt connected to you guys for
                                    the first time today.

                                    See that’s what it’s all about!

                                    That smile said a thousand words,
                                    Charlie! You were saying I told
                                    you so, but I also forgive you! I
                                    understood it all!

                                    And I could tell you were truly
                                    sorry about me missing the Lion
                                    feeding from that look on your
                                    face, Mac.

                                                  CHARLIE
                                    See, with the texts even tough we
                                    were in constant communication, we
                                    weren’t really communicating at
                                    all.

                  Suddenly Dee texts: ”                                      .”                                            *

                  Dennis and Charlie start to laugh.
