        OVER BLACK, WE HEAR:

                                    CHARLIE (O.S.)
                          Jerry, Jerry, Jerry. I’m so sick of
                          hearing about Jerry.

                                    DENNIS (O.S.)
                          Charlie, I need the keg changed!
                          It’s tapped!

1       INT. PADDY’S PUB - DAY (D1)                                                                             1

        There’s a decent number of customers. DENNIS is behind the                                                  *
        bar, serving drinks. CHARLIE talks to FRANK, who’s just                                                     *
        sitting, inhaling a sandwich.                                                                               *

                                     CHARLIE
                          Jerry’s a bad influence on you. If
                          he jumped off a bridge, would you
                          jump, too?

                                    FRANK
                          Which bridge?

                                    DENNIS
                          Will you two stop arguing with each
                          other and do your jobs? We finally
                          got a bunch of customers in here.
                          Let’s take advantage of it. Can I
                          get a new keg, dude?

                                    CHARLIE
                          Can you please just tell him to get
                          rid of Jerry first?

                                    DENNIS
                          I don’t even know who that is.

                                    FRANK
                          My tapeworm.

                                    DENNIS
                          What? You have a tapeworm?

                          Yeah.

                                    DENNIS
                          Okay. You know what? Look, don’t do                                                    *

                          Okay. I guess I’m sensitive about
                          Jerry ‘cause it’s Valentine’s Day.                                                     *
                          But maybe we should focus on the
                          bar. You want me to put pink ink in
                          the keg?

                                     DENNIS
                          No. No Valentine’s Day stuff.                                                          *
                          Everyone is here ‘cause they don’t                                                     *

                          Let’s not remind them of that with                                                     *

                          Fine. Just ask him to get lost so
                          Frank and I can get back to the way
                          we were.

                                            DENNIS
                          Who?

                                            CHARLIE
                          Jerry.

                                    DENNIS
                          The worm?! It’s an intestinal
                          parasite, incapable of complex
                          thought.

        REVEAL a hard-faced delivery woman, in FedEx type uniform.
        This is DOTTIE. Dee for short.

                                    DOTTIE
                          You just described my ex-husband.

        Dennis chuckles a little too hard.                                                                       *

                          Well, it’s not really about age,
                          it’s about freshness but whatever.

                          everything you’re doing and come
                          outside. There’s a crate in the
                          alley.

                                    DENNIS
                          No. I don’t want them out of the
                          bar. I’m saying why are we running
                          out of the bar to look in some dumb
                          crate?

                                    MAC
                          Well, it’s not the crate. It’s the                                                     *
                          mystery of what’s inside the crate.

                          No, not the straw.

                                    DEE
                          Yeah. Don’t you want to see what’s
                          inside?

                          It’s worth a look.

                                     DENNIS
                          No. It’s not worth a look. It never
                          is. Look, we always do this. We go
                          running off expecting to find great
                          things in the world, like gold or
                          rocket launchers, but we never find
                          them, and then we come back to an
                          empty bar. Our business suffers for
                          it. I mean, for the love of god,                                                       *

                          I’m saying, when was the last time
                          we stayed at Paddy’s and just did
                          our jobs?

                          Oh, so you’re talking about, like,                                                     *
                          a booze for money scheme? Smart.

                          All of us, when we bought this bar.
                          That scheme’s been around thousands
                          of years and it always works. Now
                          for once, can we not talk about
                          worms, or chase crates or yell at
                          the customers and can we please,
                          for once, just do our jobs?

        TITLE: “THE GANG TENDS BAR”

        TITLE: “IT’S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA”

2       INT. PADDY’S PUB - LATER (D1)                                                                            2

        The bar is a little more crowded now. We see QUICK POPS of
        the gang doing their actual jobs. Very monotonous. Mac checks
        IDs at the door.

                                    MAC
                          ‘89? Go ahead.

                          Damn drunks.

        Dee delivering two drinks to a table.

                          Rum and coke, whiskey soda. Pay me.

        Frank in the back office on the computer.

                                            FRANK
                          Yep.

3       INT. PADDY’S PUB - CONTINUOUS (D1)                                                                       3   *

        Dennis is behind the bar. He’s taking an order from Dottie.

                                    DENNIS
                          Another mojito? Uh-oh, looks like
                          our regular’s got herself a usual.

        Mac interrupts by rapping his knuckles on the bar.

                                    MAC
                          All done with my work! Can we go
                          see the crate now?

                                    DENNIS
                          What? You’re not done.

                                    MAC
                          Shit. How’d you know?

                                    DENNIS
                          Because the bar is still open, Mac.
                          You’re done when we close.

        Dennis starts fixing Dottie’s drink.

                                    MAC
                          Hey, you sure you don’t want to
                          sneak out real quick and look at
                          that crate? Just you and me. Nobody
                          has to know. Just to get it off our
                          minds.

                                    DENNIS
                          It’s not on my mind. Let it go.
                          Like five people have walked in
                          here since we started this
                          conversation. Go check their IDs                                                       *
                          before we have another underage
                          drinking situation.

        Mac walks off.

                                    MAC
                          Just thinking about that crate
                          man...

        Frank walks up.

                                    FRANK
                          All done with my work!

                                    DENNIS
                          They’re like dominos. Frank, you’re
                          done at the end of the day.

                                    FRANK
                          But I cooked the books already.

                                    DENNIS
                          How about you don’t cook the books,
                          so we can tell how the business is
                          actually doing?

        Dennis tries to use the SODA GUN, but it’s broken.                                                       *

                          Shit. Soda gun’s clogged again. Can
                          you go clear the lines?

                                    FRANK
                          Why don’t you trick Charlie into

                          I can’t trick Charlie. He’s
                          pretending to ignore me because

                          I meant you clear--                                                                    *

        Frank looks at his watch.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                          That’s lunch. I’m on break.

        Frank reaches into the bar condiment tray, grabs a handful
        each of cherries and olives, and mixes them in his mouth.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                          I’m craving salty, but Jerry likes                                                     *
                          sweet.

                          Come on. Don’t stick your hands in
                          there.

        Frank crosses away. Dennis smiles at Dottie.

                                    DENNIS (CONT'D)
                          Moments away from that mojito.

        Charlie approaches.

                                    CHARLIE
                          He won’t stop eating yet he’s
                          wasting away. I mean, can you

                          See this is our problem. We think
                          work is tricking people. Just do

                          Yeah. Maybe. Let me see if I can
                          trick Mac into it first.

        He exits.

        Dee puts her tray on the bar.

                          Can I get two shots of whiskey?

                          It’s not a trick. Look, the soda
                          gun is clogged.

                          I can’t make drinks. If anyone

                          I don’t know. I don’t trust Charlie
                          right now. I gave him a card and
                          some chocolates for Valentine’s Day
                          and he hasn’t given me shit back.

                          Well, why in God’s name did you do                                                      *
                          that? We don’t do Valentine’s Day                                                       *

                          Well, it used to be fun. It was a
                          goof.

                                    DENNIS
                          A goof? You all were just putting                                                       *
                          hate mail in a suggestion box

                          them got a little nasty.

                          A little nasty? One of you put
                          anthrax in the box! Or do you some
                          how not remember the anthrax scare?

                          Actually, Dee I was referring to
                          another anthrax scare. Nothing to
                          concern yourself with.

        Just then, CRICKET enters through the front door.                                                         *

        Cricket smiles and enters the bathroom.

        Dennis comes from around the bar and corrals the gang into
        another huddle.

                          It’s just such a mystery.

                                    DENNIS
                          It’s really not. It’s trash. It’s
                          just trash. But, hey, if it’s
                          mystery you want, we got plenty
                          right here in the bar. Like, what’s
                          in the yuck puddle? Why won’t it
                          dry up or harden?

                          It shifts. I’ve seen it shift.

                                     DENNIS
                          Right. There shouldn't be an
                          amorphous moving blob in our bar,                                                       *

                          How about the mystery of how you

                          Pff. No mystery there. Let’s just
                          trick Cricket into doing it.

        Mac watches Charlie mop up the yuck puddle. It’s a medium-
        sized puddle of nondescript yuck.

                          Why won’t it get any smaller? Is it
                          seeping up from the floor?

                                    CHARLIE
                          I don’t know, man. I’ve tried to                                                          *
                          get rid of this thing so many
                          times. I usually just coax it out
                          of here before an inspection but it
                          always returns.

                                    MAC
                          So basically Dennis has sent us to                                                        *
                          do the impossible.

                          There’s gotta be something to this

                          Especially to me. I think maybe

                          that I’m a gay man.

                          Well, he may have suspected it but
                          there’s no way he could have known.

                          he’s entrusted me, knowing that I’m
                          gay now and clearly sensitive, to
                          help break down those walls. The
                          whole “work” angle is a ruse to
                          bring us closer together, before                                                        *
                          it’s too late for all of us.

                          No. Not the worm. Never the worm.
                          I’m talking about Frank. If you

        Frank and Dee have disconnected the hoses from the kegs.
        There’s a disgusting grey BLOCKAGE in one of the tubes. Frank                                               *
        is blowing into one end to push it out.

                          Ugh, this is taking forever.

                                    FRANK
                          Maybe try sucking on the other end.

                                    DEE
                          And get that gunk in my mouth? No
                          thanks.

                                    FRANK
                          Fine. I’ll suck, you blow.                                                                *

                          I mean, what the hell is going on
                          with Dennis? Since when does he
                          care about how the bar does?

                                    FRANK
                          I don’t know. It doesn’t add up.                                                          *

                          work for years. I can’t read him
                          anymore. He’s always grumpy or
                          irritated.

                          doesn’t want us to “work” the bar.

                          mail. Dennis wants us to talk

                          to be a pretty good Valentine’s Day                                                     *
                          after all.

                          beat me on Valentine’s Day.

        She goes back into the office.

                                    FRANK
                          You know I did it for you, Charlie.

                                            CHARLIE
                          What?

                                    FRANK
                          I gave myself the worm ‘cause I                                                         *
                          wanted to slim down for you.

                                            CHARLIE
                          But why?

                                    FRANK
                          I overheard you on the phone
                          saying, “He’s a bit flabby.”

                                    CHARLIE
                          I didn’t say that. I said “a bit
                          crabby.” Because you smelled like a
                          crab after you ate all those sewer
                          crabs.
