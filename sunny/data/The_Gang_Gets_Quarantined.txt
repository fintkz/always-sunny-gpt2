        Over titles, we hear the gang harmonizing:

                                    GANG
                          Motownphilly's back again.

        The gang stands around the bar, singing/harmonizing, “Motown
        Philly,” by Boyz II Men.

                                    GANG
                          Boyz II Men going off.

                          Not too hard, not too sooooft.

                                    DENNIS
                              (singing solo)
                          Back in school we used to dream
                          about this everyday.

                                    GANG
                          Could it really happen? Or do
                          dreams just fade away?

                                     DENNIS
                          Stop, stop! Guys, I need some
                          buoyancy in the harmonies. Listen
                          to the lyrics: “Not too hard, not
                          too soft.”

                      Well, you were definitely too hard.

                                DENNIS
                      The lead needs to cut through.

                                CHARLIE
                      I thought we sounded pretty good.

                                DENNIS
                      “Pretty good?” Okay, “Hey,
                      supergroup Boyz II Men, please let
                      us win your contest. We’re pretty
                      good.” Look, if we wanna sing the
                      opening song at the Boyz II Men
                      concert, then we have to dazzle
                      them with our harmonies.

                                MAC
                      I feel like we should listen to
                      Charlie. He’s the music guy.

                                CHARLIE
                      That’s true. You want me to take
                      over?

                                DENNIS
                      No. The only reason we use you is
                      because you know how to play
                      instruments. And it always ends
                      with us singing something about
                      rape.

                                CHARLIE
                      I’ve never written about rape in my
                      life.

                                DEE/MAC
                      That’s all you write about./ It’s
                      an obsession.

    Frank charges in, frantic, covering his mouth with a RAG.

                                FRANK
                      He’s dead! Rodriguez is dead!

                                DENNIS
                      Frank, get outta here, we’re in the
                      middle of rehearsal.

                                DEE
                      Hold up. I’ll bite. Who’s Rodriguez?

                                FRANK
                      Sweet old guy in our building. This
                      is one of the worst flu seasons
                      Philly’s ever seen.

                                    CHARLIE
                          Wait, didn’t Mr. Rodriguez get
                          stabbed by his wife?

                                    FRANK
                          Yeah, but they stab each other all
                          the time. This time, the flu made
                          him too weak to survive it. If I
                          catch it, I could die. So could
                          you. We gotta quarantine ourselves.

                                    MAC
                          We’re not gonna die. We’re young
                          and vital. You’re old and feeble.

                                    DENNIS
                          Actually, Frank has a point. We
                          won’t die, but we certainly can’t
                          run the risk of getting sick.
                          ‘Cause you know what you can’t do
                          if you get the flu...?
                              (a beat)
                          Sing.

        They all look at one another.

                                CHARLIE
                      I gotta say, I’m kinda excited to
                      play quarantine.

                                DENNIS
                      Well, we’re not playing quarantine.
                      This is a quarantine.

                                MAC
                      I’m gonna get so blacked out during
                      this thing.

                                DENNIS
                      Do you want to lose the singing
                      contest? Why do you think we’re
                      doing this quarantine in the first
                      place?

                                FRANK
                      To protect my life.

                                DENNIS
                      No. To preserve our voices. That
                      means no alcohol.

                                DEE/MAC/CHARLIE
                      What the hell?/ Are you crazy?/
                      Shut up.

                                FRANK
                      No, that’s good. Alcohol lowers
                      your immune system.

                                CHARLIE
                      Why would we quarantine ourselves
                      in a bar if we can’t drink?

    REVEAL Dee is on the PHONE, ordering a pizza.

                                DEE
                          (into phone)
                      Yeah, lemme get two pepperoni. Two
                      sausage. Side of breadsticks--

    Frank SLAPS the phone out of her hands. Dee reacts.

                                FRANK
                      You nuts?! This is a quarantine. No
                      one goes out, no one comes in.
                      Especially pizza guys.

                      That is how AIDS got started.

                                MAC
                      No, AIDS got started from a guy
                      having sex with a monkey.

                                DENNIS
                      All disease can be traced to
                      penetration between an animal and a
                      human. AIDS: man and a monkey,

                                CHARLIE

                      And that’s why God punishes those
                      unnatural acts. Like in the gay
                      community. A message is being sent.
                      Whether or not we want to heed that
                      message is up to us.

                                CHARLIE
                      You were banging a transsexual—

                                MAC
                      And I got very sick from that. I
                      was confused.

                                FRANK
                      No more calls. Gimme your cell
                      phones. All of you. You lost
                      privileges.

    Frank takes all their cell phones.

                                FRANK (CONT'D)
                      It’s for the good of the group.
                      It’ll only be a few days, ‘til they
                      restock the vaccines.

                                CHARLIE
                      Vaccines do the trick. My mom had
                      me vaccinated for everything and I
                      never got sick.

                          on the showmanship. We need to work

                          That’s good, create a visual

                          If we’re gonna stand out, we should
                          focus more on our story. In these
                          competitions, it’s all about how
                          singing helped you overcome some
                          huge obstacle. Like,
                          I’ll do a stutter and say I got it
                          from seeing my friends blown to
                          bits in Iraq. Military stuff always
                          plays.

                          And talk about Jesus and do it with
                          a southern accent.

                          So we’ll be a group of southern
                          stuttering religious army vets,
                          dressed in a matching outfit.
                          Alright, this is coming together.

                                    DEE
                          No, we can’t all stutter. That’s
                          more of a freak show.

                                    MAC
                          Freak shows are good. Maybe we
                          could look like carnies.

                          any of this. It is a singing
                          competition, it’s about our voices.
                          Now let’s start again.

        He stops singing. Everyone stares at him. It’s strange.

                      Yes, it was a recent delivery you
                      made to Paddy’s Pub.

                      Yes, and the name on the order was?

                      Spiderman. Clever. Lemme ask you
                      this: was the caller a soprano or a

                      talk through a cut phone line.

                                CHARLIE
                      You said we’re all in the same
                      outfit. I’m just trying to
                      determine the proportions.

                                MAC
                      ‘Same’ as in matching, dude. We’re
                      wearing matching outfits.

                                CHARLIE
                      Ohhh. Well... I kinda think one
                      outfit would be better. It goes
                      with the whole harmony thing, plus
                      it’ll definitely stand out. Dee,
                      what do you think?

                                DEE

                      loving ex-m-m-m-marine.

                                MAC
                      Wow. That was good. Sad.

                                DEE
                      It’s supposed to be sad. It should
                      make them feel guilty if they don’t
                      vote for us.

                                CHARLIE
                      Congratulations, you earned your
                      spot as the head of the suit.

                          Frank, what are you doing?! That’s
                          our food.

                                    FRANK
                          Not anymore. It’s covered in
                          bacteria, thanks to Dennis.

                                    DEE
                          You’re getting a little crazy with
                          this. We need food.

                                    FRANK
                          Only naturally protected foods from
                          now on. Like oranges or coconuts or
                          snow crabs.

                                     DENNIS (O.S.)
                          No crabs! The shells could lacerate
                          your vocal chords. Get lemon wedges
                          and broth!

                          No one goes out alone! That way if
                          one of you gets sneezed on, the
                          other can report it.

                          Fine. I’ll go with Mac, but you
                          don’t have to worry about either of
                          us getting sneezed on.

        Charlie and Mac walk down the street in Charlie’s
        aforementioned BUBBLE SUITS. Mac walks uncomfortably as he’s
        squeezed into a suit that is too small for him. People stare.

                                    MAC
                          Why do I have to wear the small
                          one? I’m taller than you.

                      My suits, my rules. I wore that one
                      when I was a kid. Always wanted to
                      wear my mom’s suit. This is kind of
                      a big deal.

        Mac and Charlie are now in a small market/grocery.

                                    CHARLIE
                          First thing’s first, we should grab
                          beer. Screw Dennis and his rules.

                                    MAC
                          Yeah, he’s so controlling.
                          Although, he can do pretty cool
                          stuff with his dick.

                                            CHARLIE
                          Uh, sure.

        Charlie cracks open a BEER.

                                    MAC
                              (re: suit)
                          Wait, there’s no opening.

                                    CHARLIE
                          There’s no opening on yours. My
                          mom’s has a special pouch so she
                          could still have her cocktails.

        Charlie POURS a beer into a POUCH in his helmet. We see it
        fill up.

                                    MAC
                          She rigged her suit so she could
                          drink cocktails? Your mom’s an
                          alcoholic, dude.

                                    CHARLIE
                          What? C’mon. No, she isn’t.

                                    MAC
                          Yes, she is. But fortunately, it
                          skips a generation. That’s why we
                          didn’t turn out to be alcoholics.

        Charlie turns his head awkwardly within the suit, his mouth
        SUCKS on a tube, like a hamster. Another CUSTOMER walks
        beside them, blowing her nose, very ill.

                                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                          Uhp, we got another one. Let’s grab
                          some fruit and get out of here.

        Charlie goes to grab fruit. Mac subtly practices a DANCE
        MOVE.

                          What was that?

                          It’s nothing. Just a dance move I
                          was thinking for the group. It’s
                          stupid.

                                    CHARLIE
                          Looked pretty cool to me.

                                    MAC
                          Yeah? It’s basically a power spin
                          fly girl thing. And it goes
                          something like this--

        Mac does a SPIN DANCE MOVE and falls back into a RACK OF
        FOOD, sending cans everywhere.

                                    MAC (CONT'D)
                          Ah, I gotta work on my balance.

                          Whoa. Dude. Look.

        ANGLE ON a RIP in Mac’s suit.

         We see Dee standing on top of the desk. Her upper torso/head
         is inside an open panel in the drop ceiling.

         REVEAL Frank is in the office now, with his broom. She lowers
         her head from the ceiling. Her face is covered in Pizza
         sauce.

                           top to bottom.

                      drinking in a ceiling. Jesus,
                      you’re really getting paranoid.

                                     FRANK
                           Shit, you’re right. Sorry, I’m just
                           getting a little stir crazy.

         Frank turns to go. He then stops and turns back.

                                     FRANK (CONT'D)
                           Oh, one last thing...

         He casually POKES a ceiling panel with his broom stick. EMPTY
         BEER cans comes crashing down. Frank looks at Dee.

                                     DEE
                           Those are not mine.

         Dee then lets out a MASSIVE BURP.

         Dee is thrown into the bathroom. The door slammed closed. We
         hear it LOCK.

                                     DEE
                           Goddamnit. It’s just one beer!

                           It only takes one germ, Dee.

         She turns and we REVEAL Dennis who looks ILL (pale face, weak
         looking).

                                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
                           Of course, how anyone thinks a germ
                           would survive a scalding hot pizza
                           is beyond me.

                                     DEE
                           You look terrible. You’re sick.

                                     DENNIS
                           Dee, please. If I found myself
                           falling ill, I’d simply say:
                               (slightly weak)
                           Sickness, be gone! And it would be.

         Frank pulls out a STRAIGHT RAZOR. He glares at them, tense.

                                     FRANK (CONT'D)
                           No breaches on your end, right?

         Mac and Charlie look at one another. Mac’s nervous. Then:

                           Get some of this filthy hair off my

         Mac is now in the bathroom. Frank and Charlie stand across
         the threshold, in the main area of the bar, looking in.

                           It’s for the good of the group.

                           This is bullshit! I’m fine!

         Frank CLOSES the door and locks him in. REVEAL Dee, who looks

                           I’d stand over there. I actually am

                      Guys...

    Everyone turns to Dennis who now looks like Doc Holliday from
    “Tombstone,” in his final stages of death from TB.

                                DENNIS (CONT'D)
                      I think I might be coming down with
                      something, too.

    Dennis COUGHS into a rag.

                                CHARLIE
                      Dude, I think you might die.

                                DEE
                      I might die, too. I’ve never been
                      this sick before.

                                MAC
                      Me neither. If I am gonna die, I
                      gotta get something off my chest...
                      What is nightcrawlers, Charlie?

                      You guys really wanna know? Fine,
                      but if I’m gonna die, I want a
                      drink first.

    Charlie grabs a CLEANING BOTTLE, under the sink.

                                DENNIS
                      I knew you drank cleaning supplies.

                                CHARLIE
                      It’s whiskey. I stash it in here.

                      You hide alcohol in the bathroom of
                      a bar? You really are an alcoholic.

                           the bed, you’re looking for minerals?

                           better be under the bed. How would
                           a mineral be on top of the bed?

                      Me too. How did we get better so

                      sitting here, drinking.

                           Well... I’m a doctor. So my
                           professional opinion is that your
                           friend is very sick.

                                DOCTOR
                      No. You have severe dermatitis from
                      covering your body in hand
                      sanitizer. You also have the flu,
                      but that’s not nearly as serious.

                                DENNIS
                      Well, you’re a doctor, I’m sure
                      you’ll fix it. But what about the
                      Boyz II Men concert? Do you think
                      we have a shot?

                                DOCTOR
                      I have no idea.

    A MALE NURSE enters wearing a coat.

                                 MALE NURSE
                      Boys II Men? That concert is
                      cancelled.

                      So we did this for nothing?

                                DENNIS
                      Not nothing, Mac. We came together
                      in harmony.

                                CHARLIE
                      To tell you the truth, I’d rather
                      go back to the bar and drink more,
                      anyway.

                                DEE
                      Me too. I’m starting to get the
                      shakes.

                                MAC
                      Right. We can drink and sing in the
                      bar, like we always do.

    They all head out. The Male Nurse takes off his coat
    revealing his EXTREMELY HAIRY ARMS.

                                MALE NURSE
                      Okay. We got to get that sanitizer
                      off you. You ready for a sponge
                      bath?

    Frank looks at the hair.
