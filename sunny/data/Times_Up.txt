        OVER BLACK, WE HEAR:

                                    CHARLIE (O.S.)
                          Hurry up, I want a good seat.

                                    DENNIS (O.S.)
                          We’re at a sexual harassment
                          seminar. There are no good seats.

1       INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY (D1)                                                                          1

        Thirty men and women mill around. There’s a PROJECTION SCREEN
        up front. CHARLIE, DENNIS, MAC, and FRANK find their seats.

                                    MAC
                          This is so unfair. I’m not saying
                          it doesn’t happen all the time to
                          loads of women, but I’ve never
                          harassed anyone. I’m one of the
                          good guys! So why am I here?

                                    DENNIS
                          Because some internet warrior put
                          Paddy’s on a list of ‘unsafe places
                          for women’ and we cannot afford
                          that. Not in this climate.

                                    FRANK
                          You kids and your climates. Back in
                          the day, I slept with all my
                          secretaries. That’s just how we did
                          things then. I’d hire these young
                          girls with no experience, bang ‘em,
                          then promote ‘em. It was win-win
                          for everybody. Except the wives.

                                    DENNIS
                          Guys, this is serious. The future
                          of Paddy’s depends on us completing
                          this seminar. You guys should be
                          really worried.

                                       CHARLIE
                             I’m not worried about anything. If
                             anybody should be worried about
                             weird shit with women it’s you bro.

                                       MAC
                             I bet we’re only on that list
                             because you DENNIS’d some chick and
                             now we’re paying for it.

                                       FRANK
                             Way to go, perv. You happy now?

                                       DENNIS
                             This isn’t just about me. We’re
                             here because women are on the
                             rampage now and anyone could be
                             taken down at any moment. So, no
                             I’m not happy. Who could possibly
                             be happy right now?

                                               DEE (O.S.)
                             Hey-o!

           REVEAL DEE has just arrived. She’s got POPCORN and a SODA and
           she’s heading toward them.

                                       DEE (CONT'D)

                             Timezup, timezup, timezup.

           Dee pushes her way through the row and sits next to the guys.

                                       MAC
                             What are you doing here, Dee?

                                       DEE
                             You think I’d miss the chance to

                             flames? Hell no.

                             Oh. There are no points.

                             Well everything is graded on

                                       KATE
                             Sir, all you have to do is complete
                             the seminar and your bar will have
                             its name removed from the list.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Actually, our bar was put on that
                             list by mistake. We don’t really
                             have a history of any misbehavior
                             at Paddy’s.

                             Well, I’m sure many people feel
                             that way, but I encourage you to
                             keep your minds open--

           Dee LAUGHS alone at her joke.

                                        KATE
                             Ma’am, that kind of language is not
                             appropriate in a professional
                             setting. That’s one of the things
                             you’ll learn during this seminar
                             and...

                             Okay well, I’m just trying to get
                             through the introduction here. But
                             since you asked... federal law is
                             300 days from last act, depending
                             on the state-- Are you leaving?

           Frank is already halfway to the door.

                             Frank!

                             ‘92 tops.

           Frank keeps walking. Dennis has to think fast.

                                       DENNIS
                             Pardon me, Kate, but aren’t some
                             states considering extending or
                             even eliminating that statute of
                             limitations? States like... Nevada?

           That word stops Frank in his tracks.

                             It’s possible. Yes.

           Frank tugs at his collar.                                                                                    *

                             Nevada huh? Shit. I gotta make some
                             calls.

           Frank pulls out his PHONE and wanders off.

                             Right. You know what? Let’s just
                             jump ahead to the group work.

                                       KATE (CONT'D)
                             Half of you will go with me, and
                             the rest will be lead by my
                             associate, Alan.

           Kate gestures to her partner, ALAN.

                                       MAC
                             Okay, here we go. Here’s the
                             bossman.

                                       CHARLIE
                             He’s so tall. He does seem more in
                             charge.

                                        MAC
                             Yeah. There’s something grating
                             about her.

                                       CHARLIE
                             I trust this guy for some reason.

                                       MAC
                             Ma’am? We’d like to be with him.

                                       KATE
                             Actually, I think we should split
                             your group up.

           Kate and Alan walk off. The Gang huddles up.

                                       DENNIS
                             Damn. That’s gonna make it harder
                             for me to keep tabs on you.

                                       MAC
                             Don’t worry, Dennis. I’ll do real
                             good and score all the points so we
                             can get that certificate or
                             whatever.

                                       DENNIS
                             What? There are no points.

                                       MAC
                             There’s always-- The Eagles--

           Alan addresses his group.

                                       ALAN
                             I need a volunteer.

           Charlie, Mac, and Dee throw their HANDS UP. But Alan picks
           TWO RANDOM MEN instead and hands them each a SCRIPT. They
           begin a role-play scenario.

                                       “EMPLOYEE”
                             Good morning, boss.

                                       “BOSS”
                             Hello, Johnson. Have that report on
                             my desk by five. Hey, did you see
                             the boobs on the new intern?

                                       ALAN
                             And stop. Now can anyone tell me
                             what the boss did wrong?

                                       DEE
                             Uh, yeah. He didn’t project,
                             stumbled over his lines--

                                       ALAN
                             No, I mean in this scenario.

                                       “EMPLOYEE”
                             He used vulgar language?

                                       ALAN
                             That’s correct.

                             So what? She didn’t hear it. That’s
                             just locker room talk between guys.

                                       ALAN
                             That’s a common misconception. Lewd
                             comments can be harassment, even
                             when directed toward a third party.

                             Yeah, but it wasn’t for her. It was
                             about her. Why is she always
                             sticking her nose in where it
                             doesn’t belong?

                             No. It’s the employee the boss was
                             speaking to that was offended.

                                       MAC
                             But he thought it was hilarious...
                             but not this guy cause the boss
                             didn’t deliver the joke right.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Well we don’t know if it’s funny
                             ‘cause we haven’t seen the boobs.

                                       DEE
                             You guys don’t know it’s funny
                             ‘cause these guys are terrible
                             actors.

                                       ALAN
                             Okay. Let’s switch gears and try a
                             scenario that’s more familiar to
                             you. What’s your job at the bar?

           Head of security.                                       Doorman.

                                       ALAN
                             So in this scenario, you’re outside
                             the bar checking IDs. I’ll also
                             need a female customer--

           Dee LUNGES FORWARD to volunteer.

                             Okay. Now, just do your job as you
                             normally would. I’ll stop you when
                             you cross into a gray area.

                                       DEE
                             And what’s my character?

                                       ALAN
                             No. That was assault.

                                       MAC
                             Assault? No way. Dee, tell him I
                             didn’t assault you.

                                       DEE
                             Actually, now that I’ve some
                             distance from the event...

                                       MAC
                             Bullshit! She’s lying! We do stuff
                             like that all the time.

                                       ALAN
                             Then you’ve got a big problem. She
                             could press charges.

                                       DEE
                             Is that so?

                             Hey, is it sexual harassment when a
                             man calls his female co-worker a
                             bird all the time?

           There’s a BUFFET with snacks and coffee. Dennis and Frank sit
           down at a table. Frank’s still in the ROBE.

                             It’s okay. Don’t panic. A passing
                             glance is not sexual harassment.

                                       DEE
                             Nice. I like your strategy. Getting
                             them all horny with your titties.
                             That’s when they make their
                             mistakes.

                                       KATE
                             Well, ma’am that’s victim blaming.

                                       DEE
                             No. I’m blaming Frank ‘cause he’s
                             been staring at your boobs this
                             whole time. He’s still doing it.

           Kate turns to see Frank STARING at her chest. Mac nudges him.

                                               MAC
                             Frank!

                             Sorry! What?! Now I’m not allowed
                             to like things anymore!? It’s a

                             Cause they’re not even that great
                             anyway. It makes her feel good.

                             I’m so sorry about him. Is this
                             going to affect our points?

                                       DENNIS
                             Why do I even--?

                                       CHARLIE
                             It’s a gas.

                                       DENNIS
                             Never mind. Just continue being

                             dripping with sweat.

           Alan addresses the group.

                                       ALAN
                             Okay. Next, we’re gonna look at a
                             real-world example from a business
                             right here in Philly. This incident
                             involved a woman, let’s call her
                             “the waitress”--

           We clock CHARLIE’S REACTION.

                                       ALAN (CONT'D)
                             --who worked a local coffee shop.
                             This particular waitress was being
                             harassed by one of her customers.

           Charlie seems more nervous.

                                       ALAN (CONT'D)
                             He followed her home from work, dug
                             through her trash, and called her
                             repeatedly until eventually she
                             complained to her boss about it.
                             The boss took no action. Now, who
                             is legally at fault here?

           REVEAL Charlie has sweat through his shirt.

                                       DEE
                             Uh-oh, Charlie.

                                       CHARLIE
                             The Waitress is. For not seeing

                             It’s just a random example,
                             Charlie. It could be about anyone.

                                       CHARLIE
                             I’m just saying don’t judge The
                             Customer before you know all the
                             facts. Like maybe The Waitress only
                             thought she hated The Customer and
                             then BAM! Fifteen years later they
                             have sex once.

                                       ALAN
                             That doesn’t mean the customer
                             didn’t harass her.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Then I guess The Customer’s friends
                             harassed her too, because she had
                             sex with all of them! And Dennis!

                                       DEE
                             That’s true.

                                       DENNIS
                             Hey, don’t-- It’s just an example!

                                       DEE
                             She also did hand stuff with Mac.

                                               MAC
                             She did.

                                       CHARLIE
                             So wait, it’s all The Customer’s
                             fault, huh?

                                       KATE
                             Actually, it’s the boss’s fault.
                             Once the harassment was reported,
                             it became the boss’ responsibility
                             to ensure his employee had a safe
                             work environment.

                             The boss? Shoulda known. I always
                             hated Seth. Creep.

                                       DENNIS
                             You don’t know his name.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Well it doesn’t matter anyway cause
                             she just said what I did to her was
                             Seth’s fault.

                                       ALAN
                             I just want to be clear. What the
                             customer did was also harassment.
                             Maybe worse. So if you are him, you
                             could be in serious trouble.

           Charlie SWALLOWS HARD and wipes his forehead.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Well, if I did harass anyone, it
                             wasn’t my fault. I was molested.

                                       DENNIS
                             Now that is true. Charlie got
                             molested. By his Uncle Jack.

                                       CHARLIE
                             No. I never said-- I got molested
                             by Dee!

                             What? I never molested you!

                                       CHARLIE
                             Yes you did. A few years ago, Dee
                             and I had sex and I didn’t want to.

                                       DENNIS
                             Ugh. You had sex with Charlie?

                             Yeah, but it was consensual.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Well, I was intimidated by your
                             much larger frame.

                                       DEE
                             What!? My frame is very dainty. And
                             you never told me to stop.

                                       CHARLIE
                             That’s not true. I gave you a
                             series of nonverbal cues.

                                       DEE
                             What?! Why didn’t you give me
                             verbal cues?

                             But wait, I can’t harass him. I’m a
                             woman! MeToo and all that shit.
                                 (to Kate)
                             Back me up, girlfriend.

                             Actually, a woman can sexually
                             harass and even rape a man. Is that
                             what happened here?

           Dee is REALLY SWEATING now.

                                       DEE
                             Come on, now. Let’s not start
                             throwing the R-word around.

                             Yeah, I forced her to flush the
                             kid. That was no good for me.

                             please take their seats? We still
                             have a lot to get through and
                             you’ve been very disruptive.

                                       MAC
                             Hey, we’re trying to learn! You
                             should explain it more better.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Yeah. I know less now than I did
                             this morning!

                                       ALAN
                             Maybe if you stopped interrupting--

                             Uh, maybe if you stopped sucking a
                             fat dick!

           Everyone continues arguing as Frank wanders back.

                                       FRANK
                                 (into phone)
                             --after all that, I ended up firing
                             her anyway. Ain’t that a bitch?

           Frank’s robe comes loose. He accidentally FLASHES Kate.

                                               KATE
                             Oh my god!

                             Oh shit.

                             Larry, how fast can you get to the
                             Hyatt?

                             Everybody calm down! Take a deep
                             breath. Frank, put your penis away.

                             Listen, Kate, you two are in over
                             your heads a little here. You’re

                             this group. Tell you what, I have

           Everyone sits facing the PROJECTOR. Only now Kate and Alan

                             Here’s a statistic for you: 100
                             percent of men are capable of being
                             sexual harassers.

                                       DENNIS (CONT'D)
                             And 100 percent of women are
                             capable of being sexually harassed.

           GRAPHIC: One pink circle labeled WOMEN.

                                       DENNIS (CONT'D)
                             That’s a big problem. Now am I
                             saying that all men are monsters?
                             Of course not. Yes, there are bad
                             men out there, but they don’t
                             represent all men. Just like all
                             women are not represented by a few
                             bad women. Women like--

                             My point is: gender has nothing to
                             do with it. There’s only one thing
                             that determines whether a person
                             will be accused of sexual
                             harassment. And that... is ugly.

                                       DENNIS (CONT'D)
                             Allow me to explain. Here is a
                             graph of Ugliness as it relates to
                             Time.

           GRAPHIC: A graph with the x-axis “UGLY” and y-axis “TIME.”
           The bottom half is shaded red and labeled “TIME’S UP!” An
           arrow descends from left to right.

                                        DENNIS (CONT'D)
                             Way up here on the left, you’ve got
                             your DiCaprios, your Idris Elbas.
                             They’re gorgeous. Their time will
                             never be up. But way down here at
                             the bottom of the graph, you’ve got
                             your James Tobacks and Harvey
                             Weinsteins. Sorry fellas, your time
                             is up. See how the arrow plunges
                             downward as the person’s ugliness
                             increases?

           GRAPHIC: A bunch of QUESTION MARKS.

                                       DENNIS (CONT'D)
                             I know what you’re thinking: But
                             how do I know if I’m ugly? Well, if
                             you’re not sure, assume you are.
                             Because you probably are. Everyone
                             in this room is. I did a scan.

           GRAPHIC: The words “But Dennis...”

                                       DENNIS (CONT'D)
                             Now here’s the part where you say,
                             “But Dennis, I can’t be ugly... I’m
                             rich!”

           ANGLE ON: Frank, who perks up at this.

                                       DENNIS (CONT'D)
                             And yes. Money can offset or even
                             reduce ugliness. But it actually
                             increases your risk. A construction
                             worker can cat call women all day
                             long and nobody cares. But a rich
                             and famous man? It’s fun to watch
                             him fall. Sorry, time’s up for you
                             too.

           ANGLE ON: Mac as he leans forward, listening intently.

                             First of all, you are ugly. I don’t

                             You’ve objectified tons of men.
                             Including me. Stop trying to kiss
                             me. It’s not going to happen. Not

                             a hopeless romantic!”

           ANGLE ON: Charlie, completely oblivious.

                                       DENNIS (CONT'D)
                             No, you’re not. You’re a sad,
                             pathetic wretch of a man, so
                             desperate to be loved that you will
                             dig through actual garbage. And
                             there is nothing more hideously
                             unattractive than desperation. To
                             either sex. And most animals.

           Charlie puts an arm around Frank, to comfort him.

                                               DENNIS (CONT'D)
                             Not him!

           Charlie sees a stranger and goes to comfort him.

                                       DENNIS (CONT'D)
                             Not him either! Never mind. Time’s
                             up!

           GRAPHIC: The fourth and final “But Dennis...” appears.

                             “But Dennis, I can’t be ugly... I’m
                             a woman.” Yes you can. You’re lanky
                             and your hair looks like a wig.

           ANGLE ON: Dee who looks annoyed.

                             But here’s the good news: it’s not
                             a crime to be ugly. But you can’t
                             be ugly and sloppy. Take me, for
                             instance. I’m neither.

                             See that? That’s 11 percent body
                             fat. Which is why the only place
                             you’ll see me sweating... is at the
                             gym. I keep my body tight. But I
                             also keep my life tight.

           camera with a finger to his temple like “I’m smart.”

                             I’m protected. I’ve got the tapes,
                             the receipts, all time-stamped and
                             coded. After every encounter, I
                             received a text confirming each
                             partner’s consent and enjoyment.
                             You may ask, would a woman really
                             text that? Their phones did. I’ve
                             got the documents to prove it so...

           Dennis shakes it off and gets back to the speech.

                                       DENNIS (CONT'D)
                             But some of you haven’t been as
                             careful as I have, and none of you
                             are as handsome as I am. So what
                             can you do to save yourselves now?
                             Clean up your act. Otherwise,
                             you’re going down and I don’t want
                             to go down with you. I’ve been
                             telling you for years, but you
                             refused to listen. So I had to find
                             a way to make you listen. Which is
                             why... I made the Shitty Bar List.

                                       DENNIS (CONT'D)
                             That’s right. I made a spreadsheet,
                             posted it online. I even hired
                             these two chumps to host a seminar.

                                       ALAN
                             Wait. You hired us?

                                       DENNIS
                             That check won’t clear, by the way.
                             And who still uses checks? Grow up.

                                       KATE
                             You’re a monster.

                                       DENNIS
                             Oh yeah? Prove it.

           Dennis drops the REMOTE and leaves the stage. The rest of the                                                 *
           Gang surrounds him.

                                       MAC
                             That was so awesome, dude!

                                       CHARLIE
                             I was entertained, but I also
                             learned a lot.

                                       DEE
                             Pretty drastic move to publicly
                             expose us but I see why you did it.

                                       FRANK
                             And you are right, Dennis. Women
                             are just out to get us.

                                       DENNIS
                             Well, no. Women are right. Men are
                             monsters. We’re constantly
                             harassing them. I’m just saying we
                             need to be more careful not to get
                             accused.

                                       MAC
                             And to stop harassing people.

                                       DENNIS
                             Meh. One step at a time. We don’t
                             want the whole system to collapse.
                             Who wants margaritas by the pool?

                                               CHARLIE/MAC
                             I do!/Me!

                                       DEE
                             Me too!

                             Uhp!

           The Gang shares a laugh as they exit. What a fun day.

                                       DEE (CONT'D)
                             Hey, how big you think that Alan
                             guy’s dick was?

                                       GANG
                             Oh huge./He’s so tall./I took a
                             peek in the bathroom.


                                                   END OF SHOW
