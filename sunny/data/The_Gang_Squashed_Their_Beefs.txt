                            There are thirteen extra minutes of
                            movie in this cut!

                                      DENNIS
                            I want to know what was taken from
                            me by those hogs that call
                            themselves producers. I want to see
                            what the director intended for me
                            to see.

                                      MAC
                            I can’t think of a better way to
                            spend Thanksgiving.

                                      DENNIS
                            That’s because there isn’t one.
                            Thundergun, hoagie sandwiches and
                            four extra seconds dedicated solely
                            to the dong shot!? That’s what I’m
                            thankful for.

                           It’s so much better than a

                           Totally. I never got Thanksgiving.
                           What am I supposed to give thanks
                           for? Who am I meant to be thanking?

                                     MAC
                           I’ve had to scratch and claw for
                           everything I’ve got. If anything, I
                           should be thanking myself.

          They grab a copy and start towards the register.

                           Hey, man.

                           Welcome to Mahndo Video, how may I
                           help you?

                                     DENNIS
                           Uch. What are you guys doing here?

                                     LIAM
                           This is our store now. We bought
                           this bitch.

                                     RYAN
                           We wanted to invest in an emerging
                           market.

                                     DENNIS
                           An emerging market? Video stores
                           are a dying market. This is the
                           only one left.

                           So, we’re cornering the market
                           then.

                           My eye was eaten at my wedding. You
                           don’t remember?

                                     RYAN
                           It’s skin-colored so people are
                           less uncomfortable.

                           I’m more uncomfortable.

                           Yeah, you look like a man who was
                           born without an eye. That’s way
                           creepier than a man who lost one.

                                     MAC
                           You should just get a glass eye
                           like Forrest Whitaker.

                                     DENNIS
                           Yeah, or just get a black eye-
                           patch. Embrace it. Losing an eye’s
                           bad ass.

                           It’s not bad ass, man. I have no
                           depth perception.

                           Look, I don’t want to get into a
                           whole thing about missing eyes and
                           whose fault they are. Just let us
                           rent the movie and get out of here.

                           I got them at the gas station.

                           Why didn’t you get the ones we like
                           from the Wawa?

                           Because Gail the Snail works there
                           now. And we got mad beef. She won’t
                           serve me. These hoagies are just as
                           good.

                                     DENNIS
                           No, they are not! They smell of
                           gasoline!

                           This is a mess. We can’t rent
                           videos, we can’t buy sandwiches and
                           my apartment is an ice box!

                           We’ve got too many beefs all over
                           town. It’s jamming us up.

                                     DENNIS
                           We have to do something about it.
                           So, you know what? I say we use
                           Thanksgiving as an opportunity to
                           squash some of these beefs.

            The gang’s set up a A BUFFET TABLE with PLASTIC UTENSILS and a
            few EMPTY STERNO TRAYS. There’s a PUNCH BOWL in the corner and
            some half-assed Thanksgiving decorations stuck to the walls.

                                       DENNIS
                             See, this was actually the original
                             meaning of Thanksgiving anyway. The
                             Pilgrims and Indians had beef, so
                             they sat down at a table, ate some
                             food and squashed their beef. And
                             that’s exactly what we’ll do. Mac
                             and I squash the McPoyle beef.
                             Charlie and Frank squash Hwang--

                             Bruce.

                             Because Thanksgiving is a holiday
                             for family! You guys need to make
                             up with your Dad. I also invited my
                             mom, dad, and Charlie’s mom, but
                             they didn’t wanna come. So it’s
                             just Bruce.

                             Alright, fine. We’ll have to manage
                             that carefully. Maybe we can work
                             him for some money.

                           I don’t know about that. Indians
                           got sports teams and casinos. They
                           are still very celebrated people.

                                     CHARLIE
                           True. I don’t see too many people
                           walking around with buckles on
                           their hats.

                                     DENNIS
                           Doesn’t matter. The point is they
                           buried the hatchet and they moved on.

          Dennis pulls out a piece of paper.

                                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
                           Okay, now to that end, here is the
                           plan: Once our guests arrive, we’ll
                           get a little booze in them, then we
                           will present them with a peace treaty
                           that I’ve drawn up.

                                     FRANK
                           Peace treaty? Why are you always
                           trying to get people to sign your
                           creepy documents?

                           Because once it’s in writing, it’s
                           locked in. There’s nothing they can
                           do to stop me.

                                     CHARLIE
                           Whatever. Either way, we’ll all sit
                           down to a nice dinner of beef and
                           squash.

                                     DENNIS
                           Yeah. Wait, what? So we’re
                           literally serving squash and beef?

                           We thought it would be good, add
                           some ceremony. Make it feel more

            Liam, Ryan and Hwang eat crackers. They all seem irritated.
            Frank just stares at Hwang from the punch area. Dee, Dennis
            and Mac dance to Tom Tom Club’s “Genius of Love,” trying to
            lighten the mood.

                             Dee, go make small talk.

            Dee dances over to Liam. We now see that Liam’s flesh-colored
            eye patch has an eye drawn onto it. Dee is visibly shaken.

            Mac, Dennis, Liam and Ryan enter. Mac’s room is sparsely
            decorated with a bare mattress, a crucifix on the wall and
            two pictures of his mom and dad.

                           something.

                           Doctors are shit.

                           Goddamn medicine man, telling me
                           how to eat my food. They are shit.

                                     CHARLIE
                           Look at this. Two extremely
                           unhealthy, hard-headed old men who
                           refuse to listen to doctors. You guys
                           aren’t that different after all.

          Frank and Hwang shrug, softening.

                                     CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                           Now, let’s compromise here. Hwang,
                           what if Frank were to give you half
                           of the rent now, you fix the heat,
                           and then he’ll give you the other
                           half when the job is done?

          Hwang thinks it over. Finally:

                                     HWANG
                           Yeah, that’s okay.

                                     CHARLIE
                           Sweet. Frank, you okay with that?

                                     FRANK
                               (produces wad of money)
                           Actually, I got the whole month
                           right here. I could just give it to
                           him on good faith.

                                     CHARLIE
                           Well, great. I’m very proud of you.

          Frank lights the money on fire.

            Gail’s pulled the back of her pants down and is grinding on

            She pulls her pants up. Dee motions the throwing of salt into

                           just hope that situation works
                           itself out.

             Everyone sits around the table, making small talk. The food
             has been served. Dennis stands up, clinking his glass.

                              The Pilgrims hated the Indians and
                              the Indians despised the Pilgrims.
                              But on Thanksgiving, they found a
                              way to come together. It wasn’t
                              about apologies. Or admitting
                              guilt. It was all about peace. And
                              if the Indians knew how to sign
                              shit, they would have signed a
                              treaty. So that’s what we’re gonna
                              do. Make peace with each other. And
                              get it in writing.

                           Bill, do you have anything to admit
                           to someone here?

                           but it sure as shit is better than
                           facing our problems.

                           Or saying you’re sorry.

                           We could grab a few blankets and
                           watch it at our place. Just us and
                           nobody else.

                           That’s what I’m thankful for. We
                           don’t need to get along with
                           anybody else. We have each other.

                           Yeah. I hate people who are
                           different than me, anyway. Why try
                           to get along with them?

                           Agreed./ I like having beefs./ I
                           hope they burn.
