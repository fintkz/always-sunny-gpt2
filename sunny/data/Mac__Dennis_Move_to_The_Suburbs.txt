SUNNY...1110 "...Move To The Suburbs"                           FOR PINK         9/16/20 9.


         The next door neighbor, WALLY, 40, typical suburban dad,
         saunters over. Mac and Dennis tense up and ready for battle.

                                     WALLY
                           Hey, you must be the new neighbors!
                           Name’s Wally Schmidt, no relation
                           to Mike, but don’t tell my wife!

         Wally chuckles. Mac and Dennis are stone-faced.

                                             MAC
                           Okay.

                                     WALLY
                           Boy, it sure is a hot one today.

                                             DENNIS
                           Okay.

         They glare at Wally, not giving an inch.

                                      WALLY
                           Okay.
                               (then)
                           Nice meeting you boys.

         Mac and Dennis mad dog Wally as he walks back to his house.
         As soon as he’s gone, they soften.

                                     DENNIS
                           Was that too much? Felt like too
                           much.

                                     MAC
                           We iced him pretty good.

                                     DENNIS
                           The city has forced me to develop
                           these sharp edges for protection. I
                           gotta smooth ‘em out. I’m like a
                           goddamn stegosaurus.

                                     MAC
                           I know. The whole time I was
                           watching his hands, thinking: “Is
                           this guy gonna pull a knife?”

                                     DENNIS
                           We should work on that. I’m all
                           tense now. Luckily, I got the
                           commute to relax.

                            Don’t wanna carry this energy into
                            the work day. I’ll see you for
                            dinner.

  6       INT./EXT. RANGE ROVER - LATER (D3)                                                                      6

          Dennis drives on the highway. He talks to the other drivers,
          despite his windows being rolled up.

                                      DENNIS
                            Merge, you fool! Seize the gap. I
                            shouldn’t have to use my brakes, it
                            should be seamless. This is so
                            goddamn inefficient. Oh, you fat
                            cow--
                                (stopping himself)
                            Don’t let it get to you. Melt into
                            it.

          He pops in BRYAN ADAMS’ GREATEST HITS CD. We hear the opening
          of “Summer of ‘69.” Dennis exhales.

          Dennis and Mac sit at the dinner table. The house is now                                                *
          littered with TRASH.                                                                                    *

                            Mac and cheese again, huh?

                                      MAC
                            Well, yeah. It’s my signature dish.
                            Mac’s Famous Mac & Cheese.

                            Famous for being served every

                            It has Mac in it twice. Kind of a
                            play on words.

                           Traffic was challenging. But I was

                            Took me a few tries to find the

          Mac and Dennis lay wide awake. The pool filter is deafening.

          TITLE: “A WEEK LATER”

  9       INT. RANGE ROVER/EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY (D4)                                                        9

          Dennis tears down the street, manic. The car in front of him
          pulls into a driveway without signaling. Dennis leans on his
          horn.

                                      DENNIS

          Dennis pulls into his own driveway, two doors down. He gets
          out of the Range Rover, hot.

          Another car BURNS down the street and Dennis runs after it.

           Dennis enters, ranting.

           He turns the corner to find a POOL GUY, relaxing with a beer.                                            *
           Mac sits across from him. The place looks like shit.

                                       DENNIS (CONT'D)
                             Oh. I didn’t know we had company.

                                       MAC
                             This is Jimmy, the pool guy. He
                             fixed the filter. I invited him to
                             stay for dinner.

                                       DENNIS
                             Mac, can I speak to you in the
                             kitchen, please?

                                        MAC

                             Excuse us.

           Mac follows Dennis into the kitchen. We stay on Jimmy as we
           hear the sounds of a MUFFLED ARGUMENT.

           A moment later, Mac returns, hat in hand.

                                       MAC (CONT'D)
                             Jimmy, this is so embarrassing, but
                             it just dawned on me that we
                             already have plans tonight, so...
                                 (off Dennis’ look)
                             You should go.

           Mac and Dennis eat in silence.

                                       DENNIS
                             I’m just confused. See, here I
                             thought our pool was outside. I
                             didn’t realize we had an indoor
                             pool. That’s the only explanation
                             for the pool guy to be in the
                             house, right? To take a look at our
                             indoor pool. We must be very
                             wealthy.

                                       MAC
                             Can we just enjoy our dinner and
                             forget about it?

                                       DENNIS
                             Absolutely. It’s just funny. We
                             have enough money for two pools,
                             but not enough for a recipe book,
                             since we’re eating mac & cheese
                             again.

                                       MAC
                             You know, it’s not easy being
                             cooped up all day by myself. At
                             least you get to go to work.

                                       DENNIS
                             Really? Really? I “get” to go to
                             work, do I? What a treat for me.

           Dennis storms out.

           Dennis tries to sleep, when there’s a LOUD CRASH in the...

           Dennis peers into the hallway to find Mac bashing the floor

                             I’m going to say something and it
                             might not be popular: I hate it
                             here. I miss the city.

                                       MAC
                             Yes! I miss the action. And the
                             culture. I mean, there’s not a
                             single museum out here.

                                       DENNIS
                             You don’t go to museums.

                             But I walk by the banners for the
                             exhibits and I feel sophisticated.

                                       DENNIS
                             I thought this place would soften
                             my edges, but they’re sharper than
                             ever. I’m more stegosaurus than man
                             at this point.

                             I can’t be holed up in here all
                             day, fixing and cooking and
                             cleaning. I didn’t go to school for

                             Alright, calm down. I’ve got an
                             idea. Let’s invite the gang over.
                             We’ll clean up the house, have a
                             nice dinner, show them how great
                             we’re doing. Then we’ll feel Frank
                             out about the bet, which in
                             retrospect is completely
                             ridiculous.

                             was that he’s old, not that he’s
                             old and black. That’s a whole other

                             things were!

           Mac and Dennis consider this.

           Dennis and Mac are at the door with Frank, Charlie, Dee and
           Old Man as they prepare to go.

                                       DENNIS
                             We thank you for the offer, Frank.
                             We really do.

                             But we’re gonna pass.

                                        FRANK
                             Suit yourself. If you feel that
                             confident.

           They start to go. Charlie turns back:

                                       CHARLIE
                             Oh, one more thing. Something you
                             wanted to say, Old Man?

                             God bless you.

           Frank and Charlie crack up. Mac, Dennis and Dee cringe.

                                       CHARLIE

           Dennis sits at the kitchen table, writing on a LEGAL PAD. Mac
           comes down the stairs in his robe. Dennis brightens.

                             was right: all we have to do is
                             exist here for a few more weeks and
                             we win.

                             cooped up and lonely.

                                       MAC
                             How’s this going to keep me from
