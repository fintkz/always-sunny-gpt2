        Charlie hustles down the sidewalk, talking on the phone. He
        carries a backpack.

                                    CHARLIE
                              (into phone)
                          Frank, code red. I got a code red.
                          I just got tipped off that the
                          health inspector is coming today.
                          They’re pulling a fast one. They’re
                          gonna be here in, like, 15 minutes.
                          I got things looking pretty good
                          already, but just do me a favor.
                          Keep everyone out of the bar today.
                          I can’t have them making a mess.

        Charlie enters the front door.

        Charlie enters and sees the bar, looking like a disaster. The
        Gang looks manic and disheveled, as if they have been up all
        night. Mac and Dee handle LIVE CHICKENS. There are chickens
        everywhere. Some in coops. Some running free. Dennis is
        painting a sign and has paint all over his hands. Frank, shoe-
        less and holding his cellphone to his ear, stares at Charlie,
        looking caught red-handed.

                                    CHARLIE
                          Ohhhh. Shiiitttt.

                                                                                                CUT TO:

        Charlie, in a panic, addresses the Gang. Everyone seems in a
        rush.

                                  CHARLIE
                        What the hell is all this?! Why are
                        there chickens everywhere?

                                  DENNIS
                        No time to explain. You won’t get
                        it.

                                  CHARLIE
                        What are you painting?

      Dennis reveals the SIGN he’s painting.

                                  DENNIS
                        A new sign.
                            (reading)
                        “Carmine’s: A Place for Steaks.”

                                  CHARLIE
                        You can’t put that up. The health
                        inspector is coming any minute.

                                          DENNIS
                        So what?

                                  CHARLIE
                        So what!? We’re not Carmine’s! We
                        are not a restaurant! I can’t have
                        him see that sign.

                                  MAC
                        Who cares? We always get a passing
                        grade.

                                  CHARLIE
                        Yeah, because I bust my ass to make
                        that happen and we don't pretend we
                        are a restaurant. No sign.

                                  DENNIS
                        The sign is a big part of the plan.

                                  CHARLIE
                        What plan? What’s happening?

                                  MAC
                        We found a loophole in the system.

                                  DEE
                        It’s a closing loophole, too. It
                        involves airplane miles and points.

                                   CHARLIE
                        You are doing a chicken, airplane
                        mile plan?

                                  DENNIS
                        We got a great plan. We don’t have
                        a ton of time to explain this to
                        you.

                                  CHARLIE
                        Fine. Whatever. I get it.

                                  DENNIS
                        No, you don’t.

                                  FRANK
                        It’s a good plan, Charlie.

      Charlie notices Frank is not wearing shoes.

                                  CHARLIE
                        Where the hell are your shoes?

                                  FRANK
                        I lost them in the bathroom.

                                  CHARLIE
                        You lost them! Goddamnit. Okay, let
                        me think, uh... do me a favor, get
                        the chickens to the back office.

                                  MAC
                        Why would we do that?

                                  CHARLIE
                        I assume you don’t want the health
                        inspector seeing anything about
                        this scam you are trying to pull
                        off, right?

                                  MAC
                            (to Dennis)
                        He makes a good point.

                                  DENNIS
                        Okay, but don’t pretend like you
                        understand the plan.

      They start to move chickens.

                            Dee, put your joke stool in the
                            basement.

                                      DEE
                            No way! It’s hilarious.

                                      CHARLIE
                            It’s not hilarious. It’s just a
                            stool with a nail sticking out of
                            it.

                                      DEE
                            Yeah, and when it pokes their butt
                            they scream ‘cause the nail went
                            into their ass. You don’t
                            understand comedy.

                                      CHARLIE
                            You don’t understand comedy! I
                            can’t have this guy sitting on your
                            stupid stool! Look, don’t argue!
                            Just do it!!!

                            Fine. Whatever. Calm down.

          She takes the stool away.

                            Frank, let’s go find your shoes.

          Charlie and Frank exit into the bathroom.

          Charlie and Frank enter.

                                      CHARLIE
                            How could you possibly have lost
                            shoes in here? Where did you --

                            It looks clogged.

                            No, no, no! I just fixed these
                            toilets. They’re in perfect working

                                  FRANK
                        Must be my shoes.

                                  CHARLIE
                        Your shoes?! What are you talking
                        about?

                                  FRANK
                        Well, when I said I lost them, I
                        didn’t mean that I didn’t know
                        where they were. Just that they’re
                        gone.

                                  CHARLIE
                        You flushed your shoes down the
                        toilet?! Why?

      Charlie moves to try to fix the toilet.

                                  FRANK
                        It’s like an anxiety thing.
                        Everybody is moving so fast all of
                        a sudden and it freaked me out.
                        Flushing things gives me control.
                        It’s a thing.

                                  CHARLIE
                        It’s not a thing. I’ve never heard
                        of that thing.

                                  FRANK
                        Should I get a snaking tool?

                                  CHARLIE
                        No, I got it. Just get out of here.
                        Go help deal with the chickens.

      Charlie reaches into the toilet. Frank exits as Mac comes in.

                                   MAC
                        Hey Charlie, I need you for
                        something.

                                  CHARLIE
                        This thing’s ruined. Hand me my fix
                        bag, Mac.

      Mac hands Charlie his “fix bag” backpack. Charlie pulls out
      a pair of pants and shoes. He starts to assemble a “fix.” We
      don’t see exactly what he’s doing. (To be revealed later)

                                  MAC
                        Right, totally. Listen, we have a
                        problem. It’s just that Dennis
                        said, “We had a great idea,” with
                        this plan. And that’s not entirely
                        accurate. It was actually my idea.
                        I mean, how can a group of people
                        have the same idea at the same
                        time? They just say it all at once?
                        That’s ludicrous.

                                  CHARLIE
                        I don’t understand why you’re
                        angling for credit right now. We’ll
                        go through the normal arbitration
                        at the end.

                                  MAC
                        It’s just that I’ve been screwed at
                        the last three arbitrations. I need
                        you to back me up.

                                   CHARLIE
                        Oh my god, I don’t care.
                            (then)
                        Who took down the glory hole
                        cover?!

                                  MAC
                        I did. I thought you put it there
                        by mistake.

                                  CHARLIE
                        I put it there because I don’t want
                        the health inspector seeing that we
                        have a place for people to get
                        their dick sucked by a stranger!

      Charlie puts the glory hole cover back up. It’s a FRAMED
      PHOTO. Charlie screws it to the stall.

                                  MAC
                        Dude, you’re taking this inspection
                        way too seriously. Back to the
                        credit issue. You don’t know what
                        it’s like to be overlooked.

                                  CHARLIE
                        That’s exactly what’s happening to
                        me right now!

                            I just want the credit to be clear.
                            It’s hard to bring it up to Dennis
                            because he can be so temperamental,
                            you know? Maybe I’ll just do it
                            casually. He won’t even notice that
                            we’re talking about it.

                                      CHARLIE
                            Fine! Great! I don’t care!

          CRACK! The lights suddenly go out.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                            What the hell was that? Why did the
                            lights go out?

                                      MAC
                            Oh. That must be the vacuum sealer.
                            Probably pulls a lot of power.

          Charlie runs out of the bathroom.

          The lights flicker back on.

          Charlie fires out to find Frank gathering the remainder of
          the chickens and stuffing them into the back office.

                                      CHARLIE
                            When you’re done with the chickens,
                            get the “Talk American” sign down.

                                      FRANK
                            Are you sure? He might be racist,
                            too.

                                      CHARLIE
                            Get it down! And find some shoes!!!

          Charlie opens the door to the keg room and fires in.

          Dennis and Dee are sending various objects through a vacuum
          sealer.

                            I can work with this. I can work
                            with this. Just start packing up
                            all the limes, lemon and olives.
                            Dee, basement, now. I need your
                            reach.

          Charlie pulls Dee down the stairs. We catch the beginnings of
          Mac sidling up to Dennis.

                                      MAC
                            Dennis, can we talk?

          We follow Dee and Charlie down in the basement.

                            Okay, Dee. Reach up and put this
                            battery in the carbon monoxide

          She reaches up and puts a battery in. BEEP.

                            So listen, Charlie, ideas can come
                            from all sorts of places.

                                      CHARLIE
                            It’s not broken. It’s doing exactly
                            what it’s supposed to do and that’s
                            the problem. There’s a ton of
                            carbon monoxide down here.

          Charlie points to an old furnace.

                            Because I blocked the furnace vents
                            to fill the basement with dangerous
                            gasses. That kills all the rodents.
                            I always do it leading up to an
                            inspection.

                            Is that safe?

                            No. It’s incredibly unsafe. We
                            can’t be down here too long. Okay.
                            Get the battery. Let’s roll.

          They head back upstairs.

                        Jesus, no. I can’t have this truck
                        here.

      The DELIVERY GUY gets out, holding a clip board.

                                  DELIVERY GUY
                        This Carmine’s Steak House?

                        You’re looking at the sign, pal.

      We see Dennis’ sign where the Paddy’s sign used to be.

                                  DELIVERY GUY
                        You guys mind if I have a quick
                        bite here before we begin?

                                  DENNIS
                        You want to eat here?

                                  DELIVERY GUY
                        Well, it’s a long drive back to
                        Ohio and I figured I was gonna be
                        here a while unloading all these
                        steaks.

                                  MAC
                        Well, not that long. It’s only 400
                        steaks.

                                  DELIVERY GUY
                        400? You guys ordered 4,000.

                        Excuse me. I have to use the
                        toilet.

      Frank runs inside.

                                  DEE
                        Well, I’m not sure the kitchen is

           Frank comes out of the bathroom, shirtless.

                             Son of a bitch. Did you flush your

                             I’m sorry to interrupt, but we have
                             a major problem. A: We are not a

                             It’s okay, we can handle it.

                             stupid plan, Dee.

                             My plan? It was Frank’s plan!

                             was pushing it.

                                  DENNIS
                        I was irritated with you.

                                  CHARLIE
                        Look. We can handle it.

                                  DENNIS
                        With all due respect, Charlie. You
                        don’t even know what the goddamn
                        plan is.

                                  CHARLIE
                        With all due respect to you, I
                        understand fully. You guys bought a
                        bunch of airline miles using Franks
                        credit card. You used those miles
                        to buy 400 steaks. Knowing that
                        this delivery company delivered all
                        variety of animal products, your
                        plan was to contaminate the steaks
                        with chicken feathers by rubbing
                        live chickens on them and then
                        repackage them. Then you were going
                        to return the contaminated steaks
                        for actual cash, taking advantage
                        of a loophole in the current
                        airplane mile system.

                                  FRANK
                        That’s damn good, Charlie.

                                  MAC
                        That’s the first time I understood
                        it fully.

                                  CHARLIE
                        What you didn’t plan for was a
                        hungry delivery guy who had driven
                        all the way here from Ohio and that
                        Dee’s oversized fingers would have
                        accidently pressed zero again when
                        she ordered the steaks. I’m
                        assuming you did the typing ,Dee?

                                   DEE
                            (defeated)
                        Goddamnit.

                                  DENNIS

                             Because today is inspection day. A

                             is going to be dining in our “patio

                             complain.

           We see Dennis and Mac slip out the front door with a small
           ladder behind the Delivery guy’s back.

                             So, I was thinking you’d enjoy
                             sitting in out patio area.

                             Well, a booth is good.

           Charlie wiggles the leg of a stool. (We’re not sure why.)

           We see Dee with a napkin draped over her arm. She stands by a

16         EXT. PADDY’S PUB - CONTINUOUS (D1)                                                                      16

           Mac hands Charlie a steak. Dennis is coming down off the
           ladder with the new sign.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Mac. Back office. Dennis. I need
                             you to be the face of the bar.

                                       DENNIS
                             I accept that responsibility.

           They head inside. The Delivery Guy’s truck pulls away and a
           SMALL BROWN CAR pulls up to its spot.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Here’s my guy.

           A woman, SANDY, steps out.

                                       CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                             Oh. Sorry. You can’t park here.

                                       SANDY
                             Are you the owner?

                                       SANDY
                             I’m Sandy Lawler. I’m with the city

                             What happened to Alan?

                                       SANDY
                             Alan was let go, on account of his
                             leniency. Shall we begin?

                             Let’s do it.

           They enter the bar.

17         INT. PADDY’S PUB - CONTINUOUS (D1)                                                                      17

           Dennis is casually wiping down the bar. He is calm and
           collected, like Matthew McConaughey in Dazed and Confused.

                                       CHARLIE
                             This is our bartender.

                                               SANDY
                             Hello.

                             Alright. Alright. Alright.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Okay? So, where would you like to
                             begin?

                                       SANDY
                             Let’s begin with the bathrooms.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Sounds good.

           They enter the bathroom.

18         INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS (D1)                                                                         18

           Sandy looks around. Charlie is on her tail.

                                       SANDY
                             I assume all the toilets are in
                             working order?

                                       CHARLIE
                             Of course. I wouldn’t even bother
                             checking.

                             I think I will.

           Charlie is inches away from her.

                                       SANDY (CONT'D)
                             You’re standing awful close to me.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Sorry about that.

                                       SANDY
                             Do I smell cheese?

                             I’ll give you some space. Do your
                             thing.

           Charlie exits.

           Charlie runs though the bar. He tosses Dennis some keys.

                                       DENNIS
                             What are these?

                                       CHARLIE
                             I just picked her pocket. Move her
                             car.

                                               DENNIS
                             Got it.

           Dennis hauls out the front door. Dee enters.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Dee, go throw this steak in the
                             furnace.

                                       DEE
                             He wants a turkey burger.

                             restaurant. He looked like a turkey

                                       CHARLIE

                             what he ordered. Go!

           She goes to the basement. Charlie tweaks the same stool he
           did earlier. (We are not sure if he is just trying to
           straighten it, fix it, or what.) Charlie runs to the back
           office.

           Charlie enters to find Mac in a room full of chickens.

                             that vent. But first count to ten
                             and then start moaning into it.

                                               MAC
                             Why?

                             Moan for thirty seconds then say
                             say, “I’m sorry.” Then load
                             chickens. Got it?

           Charlie enters as Sandy has finished flushing the second
           stall.

                             It’s acceptable so far.

           She heads to the third stall.

                             Nine. Ten.

           We hear MOANING coming from the third stall. We see that
           there is a vent right above it. We can recognize Mac’s voice.

                                       SANDY
                             Oh. I guess there is somebody in

                             Oh yeah. I see shoes and pants.

           We see shoes and pants Charlie set up earlier.

                                  guy)
                             Hey buddy, how about a courtesy
                             cough or something?

                             to see the women’s room?

           A slightly sweaty Dennis is wiping down the bar in the same
           spot.

                                       CHARLIE
                             We hardly ever have women in here

                             that, are we?

           Charlie laughs way too hard at his own joke.

                             bowels while you’re in there.

           She enters and Charlie closes the door behind her.

                             Dennis, help Mac move the chickens
                             into the vent.

                                               DENNIS
                             Yup.

           Dee comes over with a charred steak.

                                       DEE
                             The furnace cooked it way too fast.
                             It’s charred to shit.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Doesn’t matter.

                             I’m gonna give him the wrong order
                             and hand him a burnt steak? He’s
                             gonna be pissed.

                             I don’t care if this guy has the
                             worst dining experience of his
                             life. He’s not grading our bar. Now
                             go give him the burnt steak.

           Dee exits. Frank enters the bar with a box of steaks.

                                       FRANK
                             How am I gonna get all these steaks
                             off the truck?

                                       CHARLIE

                             a couple. We’ll contaminate those
                             and then get the chickens on the
                             truck.

                                               FRANK
                             Why?

                             We’re gonna contaminate the whole
                             truck. Get those steaks to the keg
                             room, and for the love of god, find
                             a shirt.

           Charlie goes back to the back office, tweaking the same stool
           along the way.

           Mac and Dennis are putting the last of the chickens in the
           vent.

                                               MAC

                             Good work. Start pulling the
                             chickens out of the third stall
                             vent. Just get them to the keg
                             room. Rub them on the steaks. Get

           Charlie exits the office. Frank is standing there, painting a
           black shirt on himself.

                                       CHARLIE
                             What are you doing?

                             I’m painting a shirt.

                             second.

           Frank runs off. Charlie picks up the stool and slams it up
           and down several times. (It seems like it’s out of
           frustration but we’re unsure.) He runs to the back alley.

26         EXT. BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS (D1)                                                                       26

           The Delivery Guy is arguing with Dee.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Hi. Is there a problem?

                                       DELIVERY GUY
                             Yeah, the steak is burnt to shit
                             and it’s not even what I ordered.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Well, I’m sorry. Why don’t you step
                             inside and have a beer. On the
                             house.

                                       DELIVERY GUY
                             I’ll just take it here.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Well, we don’t have our outdoor
                             liquor licence so come on inside.

           He enters.

                             Dee, it's great. He think’s we’re a
                             real restaurant. Okay. Toss this
                             table and chair in the dumpster and
                             push it a little further from the
                             door. It doesn’t look like six

                             inches.

                             Just push it! Then get out of here.

           Charlie heads back inside.

           Dennis is pouring the Delivery Guy a beer. Dennis is very
           sweaty. Sandy exits the bathroom. During this scene, we catch
           glimpses of Mac running back and forth from the bathroom with
           chickens.

                             Fine. I suppose. Everything checks
                             out.
                                  (to Delivery Guy)

      Sandy exits. Charlie crosses to the Delivery Guy just as he’s
      getting his beer.

                                  CHARLIE (CONT'D)

                        person. You’ll enjoy the
                        exclusivity of the lounge area.

      Charlie puts him in the back office and shuts the door. He
      turns to Dennis.

                        the steaks and chickens to the
                        truck.

      Dee enters the front door.

                        Dee, you took care of the dumpster?

                             Mind if I head behind the bar?

           She puts on a pair of white gloves.

           presses a button on the BLENDER nearby.

                                       CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                             And now check out how well our
                             blender works for frozen drinks!

                             Huh?

           Charlie turns it on full-blast.

                                 (yelling)
                             Is this good!?

                                       SANDY
                             You don’t have to--

           POP! The power goes out.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Oh no! I warned you. Too much
                             power. That’s why we never use it.
                             Not environmentally responsible. I
                             should dock you for that one. Ha!
                             Just kidding!

           The power comes back on.

                                       CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                             Look at that efficiency.

           They continue on to the keg room. Charlie takes a deep breath
           and opens it. They enter.

           The packaging machine is off. No meat. No steaks. But all
           sorts of fruit, olives, pickles and onions are wrapped up in
           plastic.

                                       SANDY

           Charlie leads her down the steps into the basement.

31         INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS (D1)                                                                         31

           Charlie leads her down. Still mostly in shadow down there but
           enough light to manage.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Watch your step. Wouldn’t want you
                             to trip on any paint cans, you
                             know? Hopefully everything down
                             here is properly painted and where
                             it’s supposed to be. You know what
                             I’m saying?

                                       SANDY
                             No. I don’t know. Where is the
                             carbon monoxide detector?

                                       CHARLIE
                             Ah yes. It’s here.

           Charlie motions to it above them. Sandy reaches up and pushes
           the button. BEEEEEEEP. She presses again. BEEEEEEEP.

                                               SANDY
                             Excellent.

                                       CHARLIE
                             Yes. Excellent.

                                       SANDY
                             Oh... I’m... feeling a little light
                             headed...

                                       CHARLIE
                             Oh, you must just be dizzied by the
                             cleanliness! Let’s get you
                             upstairs!

           They head off. Charlie nods to the shadows. We see FRANK open
           his eyes. He’s painted head to toe in black, camouflaged by
           the blackness, and holding the recorder. He nods and closes
           his eyes and walks out.

           They exit the Keg Room as Dee ushers the Delivery Man towards
           the front door.

                                  DEE
                        We can’t pay you for these. They’re

      Dee gets him out the door.

                                  SANDY
                        Restaurant?

                        If you count a bowl of peanuts.
                        Drunks. What are you gonna do? It
                        comes with the territory.

                        Alight, alright.

      Dennis, now soaking wet with sweat, wipes down the bar.

                                  CHARLIE
                        So, I think that about wraps it up.

                                  SANDY
                        Not quite, Mr. Kelly. There’s still
                        something odd outside that we’ll
                        have to talk about.

                                  CHARLIE
                        Uh... right. Okay.

      They start out the front door.

                             Is this concrete regulation?

33         EXT. PADDY’S PUB - CONTINUOUS (D1)                                                                      33

           They step out as Charlie directs Sandy’s attention to the
           ground.

                                       CHARLIE
                             We’ve had some concerns about it in
                             the past.

           The Delivery Truck peels out as Mac pulls Sandy’s car up
           behind it.

                                       SANDY
                             It looks fine.

           She looks up just as Mac shuts the door and slinks away.

                                        SANDY (CONT'D)
                             But I’ll tell you what’s not fine,
                             Mr. Kelly.

           She looks down at the clip board. Charlie hangs his head.
           Here it comes:

                                       SANDY (CONT'D)
                             ... And that’s the dumpster. The

                             you were at five and a half.

                             However, you do seem to have an
                             amazingly clean bar here.

           Behind their backs we see Dennis and Dee reaching up, taking
           down the sign for “Carmine’s: A Place for Steaks.” They put
           back up the “Paddy’s” sign just in time for Sandy to turn
           back around.

                                       SANDY (CONT'D)
                             And therefore, I am still giving
                             Paddy’s Pub the highest possible
                             grade. Congratulations.

           She hands him a form and smiles.

                                       CHARLIE
                             You have no idea what this means to
                             me.

           Charlie unexpectedly grabs her and hugs her tight.

                                               SANDY
                             Oh. Uh...

           Charlie makes eyes at Mac. Realizing, Mac tosses Charlie the
           keys. He slips them in her purse.

                                       SANDY (CONT'D)
                             Well. That was nice. Thank you for
                             taking such pride in your work. You

                                          FRANK
                        Huh?

                                  CHARLIE
                        We passed the health inspection!

                                  DENNIS
                        Oh. Who cares?

                                  MAC
                        We’re just pumped we pulled off the
                        airline miles thing.

                                   CHARLIE
                        But the health inspection was the
                        thing! I did it! I pulled the whole
                        thing off!

                                  DEE
                        We always pass. No one gives a shit
                        about that. It’s not like you did
                        anything special.

      Dee takes a giant swig of her beer and sits down on the stool
      Charlie has been fussing with the whole time. It crumples
      into a hundred pieces and she falls to the floor.

                                  CHARLIE
                        Now that’s a joke stool.

      The Gang laughs.

                                                  END OF SHOW
