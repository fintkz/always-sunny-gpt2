        MAC sits alone in flannel pajamas and a dirty tee shirt. He
        glumly eats a peach as he watches court TV. There are half-
        eaten peaches and peaches with holes all over the place.
        Suddenly, there is a BANG on the door.

                                    FRANK (O.S.)
                          Mac! Mac! Open up.

        Mac hears Frank but doesn’t bother to get up.

                                    FRANK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                          Let me in! There’s no time to
                          waste!

        Boom! Frank is kicking on the door. Boom! Mac just blankly
        watches this.

                                    FRANK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                          Come on man! I know you’re in
                          there!

        Boom!

                                    FRANK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                          That’s it! I’m coming in!

        Boom! FRANK kicks the door open and starts to run in. The
        door quickly recoils hitting Frank in the face and opening
        his nose with gushing blood. (See: Ep. #711 “Frank Reynolds’
        Little Beauties”)

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                          Oh God! Just opened up the old cut!
                          Why didn’t you open the door!?

                                    MAC
                          It wasn’t locked.

                                    FRANK
                          Look, we got to get moving! You got
                          ice in here?

        Frank starts towards the fridge to look for ice.

                                       FRANK (CONT'D)
                                 (frantic, all over the
                                  place)

SUNNY #1309         "Mac Finds His Pride"                     Production Draft 5/31/18                          2.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                          They put me in charge! It’s a gay
                          pride parade or something! Remember
                          when the bar was a gay bar? I heard
                          that was good. Shoulda stuck with
                          that!

        Frank finds some ice and begins to put it in an old sock that
        was on the floor.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                          Mind if I use this sock? We’re
                          building a float for the parade.
                          Rope in the gays. We only got
                          twenty-four hours to submit our
                          float! Christ this stings! Can I
                          use this newspaper?

        Frank begins tearing up a newspaper and shoving bits up his
        nose to stop the bleeding.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                          You’re gonna be our prize gay.
                          You’re gonna dance on top. They
                          told me to get you. I said “I don’t
                          get the whole gay thing.” But I
                          drew the short straw so here I am!
                          Let’s roll.

        Frank stops. He looks insane with newspaper up his nose. He
        notices all the peaches.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                          What’s with all the peaches?

        Mac shrugs.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                          You banging the peaches?

                                            MAC
                          No.

                                    FRANK
                          Well, come on. We gotta go.

                                    MAC
                          Nah. I don’t want to do that.

                                            FRANK
                          What? Why?

                                    MAC
                          I’m not feeling very proud.

                                    FRANK
                          Cause you’re banging the peaches?

                                    MAC
                          No. I’m not banging fruit, Frank.
                          Why would anyone -- Look, I just...
                          I don’t know where I fit in as a
                          gay man. And it’s starting to get
                          to me.

                                    FRANK
                          Christ? Now? Now?! They gave me one
                          job! And now I gotta deal with your
                          feelings?

                                    MAC
                          I don’t know, Frank. I just wanna
                          be left alone.

                                    FRANK
                          We don’t have time for this! We
                          have one day until the parade!
                          Alright, look, Mac. I never really
                          got you. And I gotta be honest. Now
                          that you’re gay, I get you even
                          less. Nothing against it but I just
                          don’t get it. If I’m being honest,
                          I’ve been holding my breath half
                          the time I’ve been in here but
                          let’s try to work together. So help
                          me help you...okay?

                                    MAC
                          Yeah, okay, I guess.

                                    FRANK
                          Good. Let’s go find your pride.

        Frank picks up a peach off the table and goes to take a bite.

                                    MAC
                          Don’t eat that one!!

        TITLE: “IT’S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA”

2       INT. STAIRWELL - DAY (D1)                                                                                2

        Frank (his face swollen and bruised) leads Mac down a
        stairwell to a door with a velvet curtain at the bottom.

                                    MAC
                          Where are you taking me?

                                     FRANK
                          Your problem is that you’re only
                          hanging out with straights. I’m
                          taking you to a club where you can
                          meet a couple of nice guys and then
                          maybe you’ll snap out of this funk
                          you’re in.

                                    MAC
                          I just don’t know if I’m ready for
                          a relationship yet Frank.

                                    FRANK
                          You’re scared, that’s all. You just
                          gotta meet some nice normal gays.
                          But listen, you gotta have my back
                          in there. If any of these queens
                          comes at me, I’m gonna go berserk.

                                    MAC
                          You’re a 75-year-old man with a
                          face that looks like hamburger
                          meat. I think you’re safe.

                                    FRANK
                          Alright, let’s try and blend in.

        They pull open the curtain and enter.

3       INT. SEX DUNGEON - CONTINUOUS (D1)                                                                       3

        Mac and Frank enter a hardcore, BDSM, leather sex dungeon.

                                    MAC
                          Jesus Christ! Frank.

                                    FRANK
                          What? This is what you’re into,
                          right?

                                    MAC
                          Huh? No. I’m not into this.

                                    FRANK
                          Isn’t this what all gay guys are
                          into?

                                    MAC
                          No! Either way, it’s not what I’m
                          into.

                                    FRANK
                          Look, just relax. Let’s hit the
                          buffet and we’ll hang back, scope
                          out the scene.

        Frank walks over to a buffet table.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                          Wow. Look at this. They have a much
                          nicer spread than the straight
                          orgies.

                                    MAC
                          I don’t feel comfortable in here.

                                    FRANK
                          I know. That’s why you gotta jump
                          in head first. Go find a nice guy
                          who’ll smack you around a little
                          bit.

                                    MAC
                          I don’t want to get smacked around.
                          I don’t want to get ball-gagged. I
                          don’t want to be beaten about the
                          buttocks by a mallet.

                                    FRANK
                          It’s a part of the culture, Mac.
                          You gotta get used to it.

                                    MAC
                          It’s a very small subset of the
                          culture. It’s fine, it’s just too
                          much for me.

                                    FRANK
                          Yeah, I get it. This whole place is
                          grossing me out.

        Frank pulls the bloody newspaper bits out of his nose and
        puts them in the chicken wings. Then he pulls the newspaper
        that’s under the chicken wings out, balls it up, and puts it
        up his nose.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                          Ah. That’s spicy. There must have
                          been some hot sauce on those wings.
                          Let me try one.

        Frank starts eating a wing.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                          That is hot. Delicious though.

        A GIMP approaches Frank.

                                    GIMP
                          Mmmph. Mmph...

                                     FRANK
                          Ah. Shit. Look out. Incoming.
                              (then)
                          Yes. Hello. How may we help you?

                                            GIMP
                          Mmmph.

                                    FRANK
                          I think it wants sex.
                              (then loudly)
                          Hello! I am not interested in gay
                          sex! No thank you!!! No sex!!!!

                                            GIMP
                          Mmmph.

                                    FRANK
                          Mac. Unzip this freak so we can
                          find out what it wants.

        Mac unzips the Gimp’s mouth.

                                    GIMP
                          Sir. I’m going to have to ask you
                          to leave.

                                    FRANK
                          What!? Why? Cause I’m straight?

                                    GIMP
                          No, because you just put your nose
                          rags in the chicken and you’re
                          bleeding all over the steamed
                          veggies.

                                    FRANK
                          Oh, sorry your highness! I’ll be
                          more careful. Hey, how much I gotta
                          pay you to let my boy Mac take you
                          for a spin?

                                    GIMP
                          I’m not a prostitute.

                                    FRANK
                          You do this for fun?! Oh my God, I
                          don’t get it. Why did they give me
                          this mission?! I got the short
                          straw you see--

                          Sorry sir. We’ll be leaving.

        Mac pulls Frank away.

                                    MAC (CONT'D)
                          Can I just go home please?

                                    FRANK
                          No way, Goldie Locks. We gotta find
                          that pride. So this place is too
                          hard? Fine. Let’s go a little
                          softer.

4       INT. DRAG QUEEN BRUNCH - LATER (D1)                                                                      4 *

        A DRAG QUEEN performs on stage. Frank and Mac sit at table
        drinking mimosas. Frank is sweating.

                                    FRANK
                          God, this cut is killing me. You
                          see anything you like?

                                    MAC
                          Not really. These are drag queens.

                                    FRANK
                          Yeah. It’s much softer. More
                          feminine. But still gay.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                          You wanna pop on a dress? Dance
                          around and sing or something?

                                            MAC
                          No.

                                    FRANK
                          Come on Mac! Here I am sticking my
                          neck out for you and you’re giving
                          me nothing!

                                    MAC
                          How are you sticking your neck out
                          for me?

                                    FRANK
                          I’m running a real risk hanging
                          around these joints. One false move
                          and these fairies could poke me
                          full of holes!

                          Do you think gay people are all
                          rapists?

                                    FRANK
                          What do I know Mac? Christ. I’m
                          sweating. I think I’m having a
                          reaction to that hot sauce.

        Frank is dabbing a napkin in his mimosa and putting it on his
        nose.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                          The acidity and the alcohol should
                          stop the flow. Gotta plug this up.

                                    MAC
                          Jesus. You’re like an animal.
                          Nobody in here is going to be

                                    FRANK
                          Well, help me out here man! We’re
                          running out of time. What’s gonna

                                    FRANK
                          Well, what is!? Like when you came
                          out to your parents, did you come
                          out as a top or a bottom? A boy or
                          a girl?

                                    MAC
                          Neither. I just told my mom I was
                          gay and she just passed gas and
                          fell asleep.

                                    FRANK
                          And your dad?

                                    MAC
                          Oh. I’m haven’t come out to him.

                                    FRANK
                          Well, maybe that’s your problem!
                          Then, let’s go tell him!

                                    MAC
                          I can’t just tell him. I’ve been
                          working on a way to do it but it’s
                          gonna take a few more weeks.

                                    FRANK
                          Weeks?! I need you on that float
                          tomorrow!

                                    MAC
                          You just don’t understand what’s
                          going on inside of me, Frank.

                                    FRANK
                          I’m sure there’s five or six super-
                          viruses that are melting your
                          insides.

                                    MAC
                          No. I mean, like the struggle. To
                          be who I am. I want him to
                          understand.

                                    FRANK
                              (sighs)
                          Oh dear God.
                              (to a Waitress)
                          I drew the short straw.
                              (then back to Mac)
                          Explain it to me.

                                    MAC
                          Well... it’s like there’s two sides
                          of me. The light side and the dark
                          side. And the one side, she’s
                          trying to--

                                    FRANK
                          Wait. She? One side of you is a
                          she?

                                    MAC
                          Well, it’s like a feminine energy.
                          It’s beautiful and nurturing and
                          she’s trying to pull me into the
                          light. But I’ve been resisting it.
                          There’s a storm inside of me.
                          There’s rain. And thunder and
                          stuff. That’s when we start
                          dancing.

                                            FRANK
                          Dancing?

                                    MAC
                          Yeah. Until finally she pulls me
                          from the darkness and I hoist her
                          into the sky in triumph. Then it’s
                          like I’m gay now. Then she cradles
                          me like I’m her child. But I’m
                          super masculine and an adult. Also
                          we fuck. It’s sort of like one of
                          those kind of things. You get it?

                                    FRANK
                          Mac, that doesn’t make one goddamn
                          lick of sense.

                                    MAC

                                    FRANK
                          I’ll never get it.

                          Okay, let me explain it to you
                          slower. And in more detail.

                                    FRANK
                          No, no, no. Forget all that
                          bullshit. You just gotta sit your
                          Dad down and tell him the truth.

5       INT. PRISON - LATER (D1)                                                                                 5

        Frank and Mac sit in the waiting room. His nose is swollen
        badly and his eyes are black and blue.

                                     FRANK
                          Christ, it’s swelling. This is a
                          nightmare.

        Frank is now using duct tape and pieces of insulation to seal
        off any areas where blood may flow.

                                    MAC
                          I think your nose is infected, man.

                                    FRANK
                          Nah. Just gotta stop the blood.
                          This insulation will do the trick.

        LUTHER, Mac’s Dad, gets lead out, looking as scary as ever.

                                    MAC
                          I’m freaking out, Frank.

                                    FRANK
                          Just don’t dance around it. Tell
                          him right away. Rip off the
                          bandaid. I’m sure he’ll be cool.

        Luther picks up the phone.

                                    LUTHER
                          What do you want?

                                     MAC
                          Hey Dad. Hope you’re well. So
                          what’s up?

                                    LUTHER
                          My cellmate ratted on me for having
                          an extra pillow. I cut out his
                          tongue with a rusty pair of pliers
                          and fed it to the maggots.

                                    MAC
                          Oh... cool.

                                            FRANK
                          Very cool.

                                    MAC
                          So, anyway, there’s something I
                          want to tell you.

                                            LUTHER
                          Yeah?

                                    MAC
                          It’s not easy to say these kinds of
                          things.

                                            LUTHER
                          Uh-huh.

                                    MAC
                          Okay... well, there’s this woman.
                          And we’re dancing in the rain.

                                    FRANK
                          Don’t do it, Mac.

                                    MAC
                          And she’s like -- she wants me to
                          be happy. And with her I can be
                          happy.

                                    FRANK
                          You’re losing him.

                                    MAC
                          And we come together and we’re very
                          passionate and in the end, we’re
                          one. And we have sex or whatever
                          and then it’s like, something new
                          is born.

                                    FRANK
                          What he’s trying to say is --

                                    LUTHER
                          I know exactly what he’s trying to

                          Son, listen to me. I never really
                          got you. But now I see that there’s

                          but in the life of your son.

                                    MAC
                          We don’t know that it’s gonna be a
                          boy.

                                    LUTHER
                          It’s a boy, goddamnit.

                                    MAC
                          Yes! You’re right! It’s a boy! Dad,
                          we’re having a boy!

                                    LUTHER
                          If it’s not a boy, you flush that
                          shit out and try again.

                          And with my help, even from in
                          here. We’ll raise him like a man!
                          Like a MacDonald man is supposed to

                          I’m gonna be a grandfather!

        He hangs up the phone and walks away.

        Frank is sitting at the bar with lemons and a hot glue gun,
        fussing with his bloody nose. CHARLIE enters.

                                    FRANK
                          Ah. Shit. That smarts.

                          Oh. Yeah. Yeah. He’s coming.

                                    CHARLIE

        Frank hustles down the hall, mumbling to himself. He goes to
        kick the door again.

                          Oh right. It’s probably not locked.

        He goes to open it and walks forward but it’s locked and he
        SMASHES HIS FACE into it.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                          Who the hell are you?

                                    BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                          Who the hell are you?

        She continues down the hall.

9       INT. MAC AND DENNIS’ APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS (D2)                                                         9

        Frank enters to find Mac, also sweaty and out of breath. He’s
        putting his shirt back on.

                                    FRANK
                              (putting the pieces
                               together)
                          Oh no. Mac. Oh no.

                                    MAC
                          What do you want Frank?

                                    FRANK
                          You were just banging that broad,
                          weren’t you? You’re trying to get a
                          girl pregnant just because it’s
                          what your Dad wants you do?!

        Frank gets more ice from the fridge.

                                    MAC
                          No, Frank. That’s not what it is.

                                    FRANK
                          You’re going back into the closet!
                          I can’t stand it! No one can stand
                          it!

                                    MAC
                          I’m not going back in the closet. I
                          told you. I just need to come out
                          to him my way. So he can
                          understand.

        Frank starts to rip newspaper and plug his nose more.

                                     FRANK
                          Ah! Shit this goddamn cut!
                              (then)
                          You know what? I don’t care. Let’s
                          go. You’re getting on that float.

                                     MAC
                           No, I’m not. I’m not ready. I don’t
                           want to do it and you can’t make
                           me.

                                     FRANK
                           Fine! Fine! I don’t need you! Sit
                           here and bang your broads and your
                           peaches and feel sorry for
                           yourself! I’ll find somebody else!
                           Another gay! Somebody way hotter
                           than you!

         Frank finds a peach with no holes.

                                     FRANK (CONT'D)
                           And can I eat this one?!

                                             MAC
                           Yes.

                                             FRANK
                           Alright.

         He eats the peach as he leaves.

10       EXT. PADDY’S PUB - LATER (D2)                                                                           10

         DEE and Charlie are working on the float. Frank walks up, his
         head swelling like a balloon, still with bloody paper up his
         nose. He feels and looks grotesque, but does his best to be
         cheery.

                                     FRANK
                           Hey-O! It’s done and done baby! Let
                           me introduce you to Paddy’s top
                           gay! Everybody in the neighborhood
                           knows him, everyone loves him! The
                           gay to rope in all the gays...
                           Cricket!

         Cricket comes dancing around the corner wearing leather pants
         and crossing leather belts as a top.

                                     CRICKET
                           It’s five bucks an hour paid on the

                           are optional and I don’t take
                           lemons. Also I’m not gay for the
                           record. All this is very much
                           against my nature.

                                    DEE
                          What the hell is this!? Where’s
                          Mac?

                                            FRANK
                          Mac’s out.

                                            DEE
                          Why!?

                                    FRANK
                          I think he’s going back in the
                          closet.

                                    DEE
                          Frank, you had one job to do! Get
                          the gay man to dance on the gay
                          float. How hard is that!?

        Charlie comes from inside the float.

                                    CHARLIE
                          Dennis is saying he doesn’t want to
                          drive. Says he’s feeling
                          claustrophobic in there. Why is
                          Cricket here?

                                    DEE
                          Frank blew it!

                                    CHARLIE
                          Come on man! You had one job to do!

                                    DEE
                          That’s what I said!

                                    FRANK
                          It’s fine. Cricket’s gonna dance.

                                    CHARLIE
                          It’s not fine. Cricket looks like a
                          monster. As do you! We don’t want a
                          bar full of monsters. We want a bar
                          full of high-spending gay men.

                                    FRANK
                          Then just have Dennis dance.

                                    DEE
                          We can’t have a straight guy do it.

                          The press doesn’t give two shits
                          about us.

                          Frank, it’s 2018. You’re the only
                          one who doesn’t seem to understand
                          gay culture.

                          Arghh. My entire head is swelling
                          up with blood.

         Frank is in the cramped cockpit of the gay pride float.

                                     FRANK
                           Okay, where’s drive?

         He finds it and looks at some directions on a piece of paper.

                                      FRANK (CONT'D)
                           Okay, I head down Wharton, left on
                           Second...
                               (then, in pain)
                           Christ. I can barely see. This cut
                           is killing me!
                               (then)
                           Okay, left on Wharton... No left on
                           Second....
                               (more pain)
                           ...Shit...gotta plug it some more.

         He starts to rip the directions up and shove them up his
         nose. Then he sees himself in the mirror and has a
         realization.

                                     FRANK (CONT'D)
                           You know what? Screw this.

         Frank pops it in gear and jams the gas and yanks on the
         steering wheel.

         Mac watches court TV. He hears a BANG on the door.

                                     FRANK (O.S.)
                           Mac!? Mac?! I’m coming in! I’m
                           gonna kick the door down! One...
                           Two...

         Mac casually opens the door and Frank comes flying in,
         crashing down out of frame. When he pops back up, we notice
         the entire front of his shirt is drenched with blood, but his
         face looks much better.

                           No. That’s from earlier. See Mac,
                           I’ve been in agony all day but then
                           I had a realization. And that’s
                           that sometimes you just gotta let
                           the blood flow before you can start
                           the healing. Some cuts just can’t

                           you. You got this thing inside you
                           and you’ve been trying to plug it
                           up. But you got to let that shit
                           out. You’ve got to let it flow.
                           Otherwise you’ll be in agony your
                           whole life.

                           You’re saying I have to get on that
                           float and dance to find my pride.

                                     FRANK
                           No. Forget the float. That’s doing
                           it for the wrong reasons. You gotta
                           do something else.

         A bunch of prisoners, including Mac’s Dad, Luther, are
         escorted into a empty room with rows of benches. They take                                                    *
         their seats. Frank and Mac stand to the side.

                                     FRANK
                           Okay, I got a few items off the
                           float for you to use, paid off the
                           Warden, they think they’re seeing a
                           Blake Shelton concert and I got
                           your Dad a front row seat.

                                     MAC
                           Frank, I don’t think I can do this.

                                     FRANK
                           Look, Mac. I don’t get it and I may
                           never get it, but I know you can’t
                           keep plugging that cut. You gotta
                           do this. You said you wanted to
                           tell him your way. So go do it.

                                     MAC
                           Okay... okay.

15       INT. PRISON - STAGE - LATER (D2)                                                                        15

         Mac steadies himself and addresses the room.

                                     MAC
                           Hello everyone. I’m Ronald
                           MacDonald. That’s my Dad right down
                           here in the middle. Dad, you wanna
                           stand up and say hello to the boys?
                           No? Okay cool. Anyway, Dad, I tried
                           to tell you something before. And
                           it’s something that may be tough
                           for you to hear. I just wanted you
                           to understand what’s going on
                           inside of me. What it’s been like
                           all these years. You see there’s a
                           storm and--

                                     FRANK
                           Just get to it!

                                     MAC
                           Right. Dad, I’m a gay man.

         The LIGHTS snap to BLACK. Shafts of MOONLIGHT illuminate the
         stage creating a quiet, ethereal scene...

         The first thing we HEAR is rain beginning to drip down from
         the sky. Then with increasing intensity -- a storm.

         THUNDER cracks in the distance. Then MAC, looking lonely and
         afraid, steps into the moonlight and kneels.

         MUSIC BEGINS -- Haunting and beautiful.

         Out from the shadows -- The YOUNG BEAUTIFUL WOMAN from
         earlier steps into the scene. She walks to Mac, comforting.
         She lays her hands on his back and a DANCE BEGINS.

         It’s quiet, tragic, rife with raw emotion. The WOMAN IS
         AMAZING. Mac, miraculously, is able to keep up. Eventually it
         builds to the midpoint -- a point of anguish and angst, yet
         undeniable beauty.

         Mac, kneeling in respite, looks up and notices that --

         HIS DAD IS NO LONGER THERE.

         The music slows. A HEARTBEAT pulses in the music.

SUNNY #1309         "Mac Finds His Pride"                     Production Draft 5/31/18                          23.

        Frank is riveted. He watches from the audience. Completely
        stunned. What’s going to happen?
        Mac hangs his head, heartbroken, devastated. The HEARTBEAT
        and the patter of the rain, the only sounds.
        Then, slowly the MUSIC returns. The BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN
        (representation Mac’s true nature) stands, defiant and
        courageous.
        SHE WILL NOT LET HIM FAIL.
        She takes him by the hand and leads him up. She whispers
        something in his ear. He steels his gaze with resolve and
        makes a decision. THEY CONTINUE --
        The song changes from forlorn and haunting to powerful and
        uplifting. Mac lifts the woman and throws her into the sky.
        He twirls her around in the rain, each move more impressive
        and as the music crescendos --
        He lifts her high into the air, their bodies in perfect form.
        A LUMINOUS DISPLAY OF HUMAN TRIUMPH.
        Then silence again. The rain stops. The storm has ended. He
        pulls her down into his arms and she peacefully falls to the
        floor. He collapses into her arms, physically and emotionally
        exhausted. She cradles him in his arms like a mother would a
        child and she whispers to him --
                                    BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                          Shhhhh. It’s okay... It’s okay...
                          It’s... okay.
        THEN CRACK! A SUNBEAM BREAKS THE NIGHT SKY. They both look to
        the heavens, their faces full of joy.
        THEN -- BLACK.
        IT’S OVER. The audience is stunned. What the fuck did they
        just watch? We find Frank, wide eyed and frozen.
                                    FRANK
                          Oh. My. God...
        WE PUSH IN ON HIM, slowly. Then come to rest.
                                            FRANK (CONT'D)
                          I get it.
        THE AUDIENCE ERUPTS INTO A STANDING OVATION.
                                                                                      CUT TO BLACK.
